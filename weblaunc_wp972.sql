They are additive to one another.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ben Thompson recently wrote about <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/\">Shopify and the Power of Platforms</a>. He highlights the difference between an aggregator (e.g. Amazon’s Merchant Services) and a platform (Shopify) and makes a case for how Shopify can successfully compete against Amazon. If you’re new to Ben’s work, I highly recommend following the links he references in the opening paragraphs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aggregators vs Platforms</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As Ben explains, Amazon is an aggregator that owns the users (i.e. customers, Amazon Prime subscribers) and aggregates the suppliers (i.e. merchants, manufacturers). Amazon succeeds by providing a great user experience (e.g. one click checkout, same day delivery) and by treating products and their suppliers as commodities, all available to the customer in a single, aggregated shopping experience. While aggregation can provide high value for customers, it minimizes the opportunity for merchants to differentiate and can ultimately hurt customers as competition and innovation are stifled.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A competitor to Amazon might try becoming a larger aggregator. It&#8217;s a difficult endeavor. Walmart <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=walmart+vs+amazon\">has been trying</a> for years. The larger an aggregator grows, the more entrenched their position, and the less likely a competitor can unseat them by utilizing the same strategy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is another way to compete with an aggregator. Build a platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While an aggregator owns the customer and commoditizes its suppliers, a platform empowers those who build on it, relying on its suppliers being differentiated and successful in their own right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Ben details in the article, Shopify’s best shot at taking on Amazon is to double-down on their focus as a platform and, by all evidence, that seems to be their strategy. Shopify wants to be the platform that empowers its merchants to succeed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several problems I suggest with Shopify’s strategy, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Data Control</strong> &#8211; Shopify has taken a strong stance on centralizing control of customer data and using their terms of service to enforce their policies. Their recent <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/shopify-statement/\">clash with MailChimp</a> (who decided to leave the platform) may be indicative of more to come. It makes sense to have a centralized source of truth for your data. Shopify’s position, though, is an all or nothing approach that results in more lock-in to the platform and more data in their control. Actions that stifle or remove <em>choice </em>from the equation for end users and the suppliers who serve them is aggregator thinking more than platform thinking. </li><li><strong>Closed Source</strong> &#8211; Shopify is a proprietary platform with closed source code. While they make efforts to show <a href=\"http://shopify.github.io/\">open source friendliness</a>, the reality is that the platform code is <em>theirs</em>. If you stop paying Shopify, you lose it all and if you don’t like what they’re doing with the platform, you’re stuck unless you choose to leave. </li><li><strong>Growth Risks</strong> &#8211; Shopify is growing fast and as a publicly traded company, they are focused on accelerating growth. Products like Shopify Capital, and the emphasis on offline services through Point-of-Sale as well as the continued push into enterprise, deepen the risk of growing for growth’s sake, rather than doing what’s best for the merchants they serve. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopify is a good<em> </em>solution for independent merchants who want to be more than an aggregated commodity. There are problems, though, and while Shopify is likely continue to grow despite the problems I’ve suggested (they have no shortage of interested investors), there is a better approach. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WooCommerce on WordPressOS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In my writing on <a href=\"https://growinwp.com/ecosystem-plugins/\">Ecosystem Plugins</a>, I introduced the concept of WordPress as an Operating System for the Open Web and cited WooCommerce as an example of an Ecosystem Plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe strongly in the importance and value of WordPress as an Operating System, a <em>platform</em>, for the Open Web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WooCommerce, I see potential for it to become <em>more </em>than an Ecosystem Plugin and serve as <em>the </em>platform for ecommerce on the Open Web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do that, WooCommerce needs three things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>A great core experience</strong> &#8211; Out-of-the-box, WooCommerce needs to have the essentials built-in and provide a great, user-focused onboarding and operating experience. It needs to be intuitive and accessible for non-technical, small business merchants, who should always be the core focus. Importantly, this is <em>not </em>about removing choices and dumbing interfaces down. This is about doing the <em>harder </em>work and teaching merchants how to make the right choices for them and use the power that WooCommerce provides. </li><li><strong>A vibrant partner ecosystem</strong> &#8211; Shopify has nearly 3000 apps in its “App Store” today. The WooCommerce marketplace has less than 300 extensions, and more than 30% are maintained by Automattic. For WooCommerce to succeed as a platform it needs to be trusted by its partners and seen as the <em>best </em>platform with clear short-term incentives and long-term value.</li><li><strong>A strong community</strong> &#8211; WordPress’ community is a <em>huge </em>key to its success. Meetups and WordCamps create a sense of belonging and shared ownership that drives a loyalty to WordPress that’s unparalleled. WooCommerce needs to create a similar community where merchants feel that they have each other’s<em> </em>backs and are able to share their love for the platform that makes it all possible.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>By many standards, Shopify is a giant compared to WooCommerce. With 4000+ employees, a $35+ billion dollar market cap, and a marketing budget to match, they seem to be the dominate ecommerce platform and show no signs of slowing down their efforts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t buy trust, vibrancy, and loyalty though. Deepening trust through a great core experience, investing in the partner ecosystem, and strengthening community loyalty is where I think WooCommerce has the opportunity to improve and succeed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three ideas for WooCommerce to increase its value and strengthen its position as <em>the</em> platform for ecommerce on the Open Web:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Introduce a WooCommerce Subscription</strong> &#8211; Provide access to non-SaaS extensions for a flat, monthly rate and easy bundling of SaaS billing for those who want it. Make it a clear win for all involved, including the merchants and marketplace partners. Position the subscription as an investment in the Open Web. The code is GPL &#8211; they could stop paying at any time and keep access. Paying, though, provides support and capital for reinvestment, ensuring the continued success of the platform. A subscription also offers opportunity to streamline the user experience for customers, reducing friction for developers.</li><li><strong>Invest in the Partner Ecosystem</strong> &#8211; Make building a healthy partner ecosystem a priority. Provide guidance, mentorship, and funding to help developers succeed on the WooCommerce platform. Build strong relationships with SaaS providers, including ecommerce focused companies like BigCommerce, and help streamline their integrations into the platform.&nbsp; </li><li><strong>Cultivate Community</strong> &#8211; Invest in and support ecommerce meetups and create more ecommerce focused events. Double-down on the Open Web narrative and encourage community members to support each other in improving and maintaining their freedom as merchants on the Open Web. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopify provides a valuable service that empowers merchants. Unfortunately, their approach to centralized data control, their closed source platform, and the risks of a growth focus pose the potential for more harm than good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that WooCommerce, with data control in the hands of its users, an open source ecosystem, and a strong independent community give it the opportunity to become the <em>best </em>platform for ecommerce on the Open Web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://www.embrin.com\">Caleb Johnson</a> for his epic illustration.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"boxy\"><em>This is a guest post by Jonathan Wold.

It also supports post categories. It automatically downloads images embedded in posts, pages, and custom post types and converts their tags to the Gatsby img component. Links embedded in posts that lead to other pages are converted to the Link component. Check out a <a href=\"https://gatsby-wp-theme.progital.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a> to see it in action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gatsby-wp-source-theme.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>So far, the Theme Jam contest seems to have been a successful strategy for Gatsby to quickly expand developer&#8217;s knowledge of creating Gatsby themes, as well as multiple their availability in the ecosystem.

In addition to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/caldera-forms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free plugin on WordPress.org</a>, which has more than 200,000 active installs, CalderaWP&#8217;s product line includes a <a href=\"https://calderaforms.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pro version</a> and more than 30 free and commercial add-ons for things like payment processors and marketing integrations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://joshpress.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Pollock</a>, who co-founded CalderaWP in 2015 with <a href=\"http://christiechirinos.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Christie Chirinos</a>, will be <a href=\"https://calderaforms.com/2019/08/saturday-drive-acquires-caldera-forms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">joining Saturday Drive</a> as VP of Engineer Experience, along with three other employees from the company, bringing Saturday Drive&#8217;s total crew number to 25. Chirinos began working as a product manager at <a href=\"https://www.liquidweb.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Web</a> earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Caldera Forms will still operate under the Saturday Drive umbrella and continue to be developed with more resources.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it ever felt to you like Caldera Forms was a part time thing, that was true,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;It’s not true anymore.&#8221; Saturday Drive is aiming to speed up development and decrease support times.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Caldera Forms is not going anywhere,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to get a lot more focus and attention now. I didn&#8217;t contribute any code to the last release, it was all Nico and community contributors. I reviewed the changes. Kevin (CTO at Saturday Drive) and I helped manage him, but he&#8217;s ready to take over Caldera Forms from me and has all of the support he needs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pollock will be focusing on improving the engineering process at Saturday Drive and working on some products, starting with SendWP. He also plans to continue writing tutorials about PHP and JavaScript development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jameslaws.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">James Laws</a>, Saturday Drive co-founder and co-creator of Ninja Forms, said the attraction to CalderaWP was &#8220;a combination of acquiring the team and the profit potential.&#8221; With more resources at their disposal, he anticipates that Caldera will become even more profitable. Laws declined to share more specific details on the financial aspects of the arrangement but shared a few factors involved in considering what it costs to acquire a forms builder plugin in the WordPress space these days.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It really depends on the form builder,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s similar to any WordPress plugin &#8211; number of customers, active users, growth trend, support load, team makeup, and so much more all goes into the conversation. Some form builders might not be worth anything. Others are worth millions. Much of it depends on the objectives of the buyer.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How Saturday Drive Plans to Market Two Different WordPress Forms Plugins Under one Umbrella</h3>\n<p>One of the more intriguing aspects of this acquisition is that Saturday Drive already has one of the most successful WordPress forms plugins in its arsenal. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ninja Forms</a> has more than a million active installs but is knee deep in competition with alternatives such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Form 7</a> (5 million+ installs), WPForms (2 million+), and Gravity Forms. Although Caldera Forms is technically a competitor to Ninja Forms, both Laws and Pollock seem to be confident marketing them separately under the same company umbrella.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been really friendly competitors for years,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;Caldera Forms had always been a developer tool with a goal of being intuitive enough for everyone. I think this will allow us to focus Ninja Forms and Caldera Forms on serving different needs. Neither plugin can make everyone happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Laws said the plan is to keep Caldera Forms as a unique brand, since it has a different user base and primary message focused on developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will focus on this difference in messaging,&#8221; Laws said. &#8220;Ninja Forms for a long time has been moving towards being more user centric with a focus towards simplicity and specific ways of accomplishing particular tasks. This direction has certainly alienated developers who want to do deeper customizations because that just isn’t our primary goals any longer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For Saturday Drive&#8217;s co-founders, the decision to acquire CalderaWP seems to have been just as much about gaining Pollock&#8217;s leadership and his team as it was about gaining the product line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Caldera Forms has always been the WordPress developers form builder,&#8221; Laws said. &#8220;Josh is, at his core, an extremely talented developer who loves helping developers. Caldera Forms is the product of this passion. We saw a great opportunity to have a tool under our umbrella that now focused on this exciting space of developers, agencies, and freelancers that needed a tool that could be truly modified to their hearts content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Laws said Saturday Drive plans to slow down for a bit to ensure all four of the company&#8217;s products are where they want them to be. &#8220;I’m confident that all the products will be seeing some very cool updates over the next 6 months,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Pollock, who has a strong interest in headless WordPress setups, said he has been experimenting with new ways to use the newer React-driven parts of Caldera Forms anywhere. He has a Gatsby + WordPress test site (<a href=\"https://futurecapable.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">futurecapable.dev</a>) where he set up a first pass at this prior to getting distracted by acquisition negotiations and daily life.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the new job is finding new ways to fill the same needs that Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, and Ninja Shop fulfill today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If the future is headless and static sites, which I think so, then contact forms, eCommerce, list building, etc. we need to make that easy. That&#8217;s the challenge I&#8217;m most interested in.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 20:15:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: July 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=7040\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2019/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6981:\"<p>This month has been characterized by exciting plans and big announcements &#8211; read on to find out what they are and what it all means for the future of the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>WordCamp Asia Announced</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The inaugural WordCamp Asia will be in Bangkok, Thailand, on February 21-23, 2020.

The Cover and Media &amp; Text blocks now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16751\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">allow for nesting any type of block inside</a>.</p>\n<p>Previously, the Cover block only allowed users to add a heading, button, or paragraph block. Users had resorted to employing clunky solutions to get around the restrictions, such as using the group block with a custom class and using CSS to add backgrounds and overlay styling. The restrictions have now been removed to give users greater flexibility in styling these blocks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nesting-in-cover-block.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Another new user-facing feature in 6.2 is the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10128\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">customize the link target</a> of the Button block, enabling users to designate the link to open in a new tab. Gutenberg Phase 2 lead Riad Benguella said this small improvement was a frequently requested feature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-31-at-5.38.50-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also introduces a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16356\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new PHP API</a> to simplify the registration of block styles variations. It offers a simple way for plugin and theme developers to register block styles using only PHP function calls, instead of using JavaScript. This should make styling blocks more approachable for those who are more comfortable with PHP.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 6.2 includes more than two dozen enhancements and bug fixes, along with many mobile and documentation improvements.

Those who are experienced using Meta Box should be able to create a new Gutenberg block in under 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rilwis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tran Ngoc Tuan Anh</a> created the Meta Box framework in 2010, launched on WordPress.org in 2011, and began releasing commercial extensions in 2014. The plugin&#8217;s user base has grown to more than 400,000 active installs and Tran now leads a three-person team, including two developers and one marketer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The revenue is not as good as other businesses, but it&#8217;s enough for us to run a small team,&#8221; Tran said. Learning React was new for his developers and it took them several months to get familiar with the framework before being able to create the MB Blocks extension.</p>\n<p>Following in the footsteps of Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), which offers ACF blocks as part of its <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pro version</a>, Meta Box&#8217;s PHP-only block creation solution is only available as a commercial extension.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The MB Blocks extension is our strategy to attract users to Meta Box,&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;Since Gutenberg is becoming a huge thing, people really need a way to work with it. With this extension, we hope to bring more premium users to Meta Box.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With more than one million active installs, ACF is the market leader and Meta Box&#8217;s main competitor, but Tran said his team is also keeping an eye on other plugins like <a href=\"https://toolset.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Toolset</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CMB2</a> (200,000+ installs), and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pods</a> (80,000+ installs). He identified flexibility as Meta Box&#8217;s chief differentiator, since it is a code-based solution that he believes gives developers a greater level of customization in creating custom fields.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main difference between Meta Box and ACF is Meta Box is more developer-focused. It&#8217;s mainly code-based, e.g. you define meta boxes and fields with code (it has the UI as a premium extension but code is still the main part),&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;Meta Box has some extra things like supporting custom table storage, making frontend forms, advanced conditional logic, and building user profiles on the frontend.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tran said he is satisfied with Gutenberg&#8217;s support for meta boxes at the moment but would like to see it improved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The way it works is kind of a &#8216;fake&#8217; submission for post data via ajax,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sometimes that makes users have to refresh the page to see the updated content. I mean for complex data, it still doesn&#8217;t have a good way to refresh the meta boxes when a post is saved. I wish there was was a way to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This may not be a priority for the Gutenberg team, as the ideal is for meta boxes to be converted to blocks wherever possible to maintain a unified editing interface. The reality is that many plugins are still not block-enabled, which is why the WordPress Plugin Directory has a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">section</a> devoted to promoting those that are.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many users still need custom meta boxes because of two reasons: building custom Gutenberg blocks is not easy enough, and a lot of plugins still require meta boxes to work,&#8221; Tran said.</p>\n<p>The availability of PHP-based solutions for creating custom Gutenberg blocks has been an important development for those who have been slow to take the deep dive into JavaScript and React. Tran said the feedback he has received from his userbase indicates that many have not prioritized gaining the skills necessary to become proficient at custom Gutenberg development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our main users are web creators who build websites on a daily basis,&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;Many of them have built a solid foundation for their work to speed up the workflow. Things such as a page builder, a custom fields framework, a powerful theme, are their daily tools. Putting Gutenberg into this toolset requires a lot of time learning and mastering it. Sometimes it&#8217;s not feasible, especially when Gutenberg is not powerful enough to build websites. Most of them still use a page builder to build websites, while they keep testing Gutenberg to see what&#8217;s new.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tran said most of his customers are using page builders like Beaver Builder or Elementor. Some give access to their clients and others do not. This is where they often look to plugins like Meta Box to help them build settings for their websites.</p>\n<p>With MB Blocks released today, the Meta Box team is moving forward on its roadmap, working on integrations with other plugins like WP All Import, and improving the Meta Box Builder to support creating relationships and settings pages with a UI.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 19:02:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: WordPress Security Team Discusses Backporting Security Releases to Fewer Versions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=92029\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-security-team-discusses-backporting-security-releases-to-fewer-versions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6181:\"<p>The WordPress Security Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/07/29/should-security-fixes-continue-to-be-backported-to-very-old-versions-of-wordpress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exploring different approaches</a> to backporting security fixes to older versions of the software. The effort that goes into supporting versions back to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2013/10/basie/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3.7</a> (the release that introduced automatic background updates) increases with each major version released.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the Core Security team, that means when security updates need to be released, we have to take the testing and release process not just to the current version of WordPress, but we have to test the changes, create code patches, and then release to every major version all the way back to 3.7,&#8221; security team lead Jake Spurlock said. &#8220;With 5.3 around the corner that puts us at over fifteen major versions of WordPress to support long term.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Spurlock said 3.7 represents <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0.1% of all WordPress sites</a> but noted that supporting older versions requires &#8220;a large amount of time and energy and hurts the team’s ability to work effectively.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked how much of a time investment is in involved, Spurlock said it varies depending how many tickets/issues have to be ported. All patches are reviewed, tested, and committed by several team members. There are approximately 50 security experts on the team, many of which are employed by Automattic, although some are volunteers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem with developing security releases for older versions of WordPress lies in the amount of testing and then reengineering that is specific to each older version of WordPress,&#8221; Spurlock said. &#8220;As an example. WordPress 4.2 received a fairly large refactor, and so taking a fix back before that time means extra testing, and ensuring that paths works for patches and more. Getting the testing suite to work on older versions has been difficult too with the code changes that accompany each version.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Spurlock called for feedback and ideas on how the security team can support fewer versions of WordPress while keeping users secure. An active discussion is underway and opinions range from enthusiastic support for the idea to opposition.</p>\n<p>Some who weighed in prefer to focus on urging users to update via emails to admins on older installs and/or a &#8220;please upgrade&#8221; widget ported back to older versions. As big version jumps can be intimidating for users, some recommended WordPress provide better ways to do incremental updates from older versions to the next most recent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the goal is to keep WordPress users secure against hackers and other rogue agents, you should continue supporting older versions with security releases,&#8221; WordPress core contributor Rami Yushuvaev said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress 3.7 represents 0.1% of all WordPress sites but WordPress 3.0 – 3.6 represents 1.6% of all WordPress sites. You don’t want to increase the number of sites using un-secure versions. With the current policy, &#8216;old version&#8217; is not the same as &#8216;un-secure version.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think you should educate users to use updated software, not to stop releasing security releases for older versions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several commenters are in favor of limiting backporting security fixes to a set number of versions, as outlined by former WordPress security lead, Aaron Campbell:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I like the idea if supporting X versions back. That allows users to know that they don’t have to update to the latest version no matter what our release cycles are, and also makes sure we can eventually hone in on how many versions are actually tenable to support.</p>\n<p>Supporting X years back would allow users to know they can avoid upgrading for a certain amount of time, but it would also mean that the security team wouldn’t always be supporting the same number of versions and if a release ever took longer than our supported time then all users would be expected to upgrade to the latest version (exceptions could always be made, but it’s harder to rely on those).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stephen Edgar, one of the maintainers of WordPress&#8217; build tools component, suggested implementing automatic major version upgrades to keep moving users forward to supported versions in waves.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe continue to ship them until &#8216;major&#8217; updates are implemented,&#8221; Edgar said. &#8220;The current thinking is to add major updates to 3.7 first, bumping 3.7 to 3.8 via automatic updates. Once that’s completed then security updates would no longer be backported to the 3.7 branch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And similarly, once 3.8 major updates are implemented, i.e. 3.8 gets bumped to x.x then again, backports to 3.8 would cease at the same time and so forth through the branches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Edgar also noted that providing users a way to opt into automatic updates for major core releases is one of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nine projects</a> that Matt Mullenweg had identified for working on in 2019.</p>\n<p>Several other commenters said they would like to see WordPress implement semantic versioning and adopt a long-term support (LTS) policy. WordPress would then clearly communicate the number of years those versions would be supported. Older sites could then be auto-updated to the LTS version.</p>\n<p>No decision has been made on the ideas proposed and the discussion is still ongoing.

The schedule will include ten 50-minute sessions (including Q&amp;A) and three 15-minute sessions. All sessions will be recorded and available on WPSessions after the live event has ended.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/speak/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Applications for speakers</a> are already open. Each speaker receives a free coaching session for their presentation and a $250 stipend. The deadline to apply is August 9, 2019.</p>\n<p>Richards said he has already had a few talks submitted on topics like image performance, mental health, and Gatsby.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’d love to see talks that angle around a case study or &#8216;recipe,&#8217; (e.g. Here’s a thing I built, how I did it, and how you can too.),&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would also love to see more talks around the area of design, front-end workflows, and things like that. I’m most excited to host presenters who themselves are excited about an idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With WordSesh officially going global in support of different timezones, Richards said he anticipates the next region will be Asia Pacific and is enthusiastic to organize it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know how many personal relationships I currently have across APAC to make a WordSesh for that region a reality – in terms of sponsors, speakers, and attendees – but it&#8217;s a big region and community, and it&#8217;s on my radar for 2020,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>WordSesh EMEA will be the second WordSesh held this year. There were more than 1,000 attendees registered for the May 2019 event and 700 participated live throughout the day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordSesh is one of the best attended WordPress events, which is very humbling,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see how many people attend WordSesh EMEA, given how much larger WCEU is relative to WCUS. WCEU 2019 had more than 2X the participants of WCUS 2018.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said he doesn&#8217;t anticipate that kind of disparity in attendance since it&#8217;s the first time for this event, but wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the attendance at this event surpasses the May 2019 event.</p>\n<p>The first WordSesh was held in April 2013 and is now six years running, thanks in part to Richards&#8217; contagious enthusiasm for hosting it and his willingness to try new things in an effort to best serve the community. WordSesh EMEA will mark the seventh event in the series.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the WordSesh events are popular because the broad WordPress community is a distributed-first body &#8211; not only the contributors, but also the majority of the agencies, product shops, and even client relationships,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thus, an event that caters to a distributed audience – watch from anywhere, replay at any time – feels like a pretty natural extension of how we already work and interact.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 22:47:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WordPress Contributors Explore the Possibility of a Global Accessibility Event\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91976\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-explore-the-possibility-of-a-global-accessibility-event\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5112:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; accessibility team is evaluating the possibility of organizing a virtual Global Accessibility Day, similar to the Polyglots&#8217; Global Translation Day. This marathon-style contributor event has proven to be valuable for the Polyglots in terms of recruiting, onboarding, and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/polyglots-team-experiences-record-annual-growth-expands-wordpress-reach-to-millions-with-new-translations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fueling progress on translation projects</a>.</p>\n<p>Accessibility contributors proposed the idea at a meeting two weeks ago after discussing the team&#8217;s desire to have more representation at WordCamp contributor days. WordCamp Europe 2019 had a strong contingency of accessibility contributors, but being present on the ground in Berlin was not an option for the vast majority of the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I heard different people saying that this Contributor Day was extremely useful, because they had the opportunity to talk in person and exchange ideas with a lot of other people,&#8221; Stefano Minoia said. &#8220;This is really good: if we want to push forward a project like WordPress, it&#8217;s extremely important to have the opportunity of working together at least once a year in person.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Due to the relatively small size of the team and the expense associated with traveling to larger WordCamps, accessibility contributors do not often have the opportunity for in-person collaboration. A remote contributor day focused on accessibility was proposed as an alternative.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a small group with very little sponsorship,&#8221; Joe Dolson said during the initial discussion. &#8220;I don&#8217;t go to most WordCamps anymore, because the time and expense is just too great for me. I&#8217;ll probably go to my local WordCamp only, this year, if I have the time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of the work, Dolson anticipates the team may face some challenges in working around some of the constraints of collaborating through a virtual event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are some tasks that work really well as remote contributor days; others are harder,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve personally found it difficult to do accessibility contributor sharing remotely.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A virtual contributor day could be helpful for some basic things like teaching new contributors how to use Trac, updating the handbook and documentation, and organizing sprints for jumpstarting larger tasks. There is no shortage of accessibility projects to work on, with the new block directory in the admin slated for this year, some major changes needed to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KiTigFSgxKTTPTKZ43K7BUP50OSqrUUQ_OZYXdIB7oU/edit#heading=h.7pmszdlkigr5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">improve navigation to Gutenberg&#8217;s advanced settings block sidebar</a>, and more general Gutenberg issues.</p>\n<p>One development that is working in the team&#8217;s favor is that Slack has improved the screen reader experience in the <a href=\"https://slackhq.com/introducing-a-more-efficient-slack-desktop-experience\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">most recent update</a>. Using threads was previously discouraged during accessibility team discussions due to their lack of navigability.

Organizers have contracted <a href=\"https://www.ahelpinghandevents.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Helping Hand</a>, a licensed conference childcare service company based in Virginia Beach, VA, to provide childcare for all three days, with flexible drop off and pick up throughout the day as necessary.</p>\n<p>When WCUS tickets went on sale in May, parents who registered had the option to indicate whether they would be interested in on-site childcare during the conference, as organizers considered different childcare options. This is the first time WordCamp US has offered it as part of the event. WordCamp Europe has included childcare for years and a handful of other camps have also had it available in a varying capacities, including WordCamp Nordic, WordCamp Pittsburgh, and WordCamp Vienna.</p>\n<p>Parents interested in using this service at WordCamp US will need to <a href=\"https://2019.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pre-register</a> by selecting a &#8220;Parent with Kids ticket.&#8221; Registrants will receive an email with a pre-registration link to complete the signup process on the childcare provider&#8217;s website. Both lunch and snacks will be provided, so parents will not be required to pick their kids up for lunch.</p>\n<p>The availability of childcare makes it possible for single parents to attend and speak at events. It can also be helpful for parents with small children who are unable to be separated from their caregivers for long periods of time. With WordCamp US opting to provide childcare at this year&#8217;s event, it&#8217;s clear that this is a growing trend to help promote diversity at WordPress conferences.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WordCamp is about diversity, this is not a catch phrase, it is not just a moment.

Meetup organizers have hosted more than 230 events since 2014, averaging four events per month.</p>\n<p>In the working <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qa_-bHMtTY1JTwHxxa28Xutg2vpaB4A7A2J9t4pXkDs/edit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a>, a document that was forked from the Nordic and Asian WordCamp proposals, organizers outlined why the timing is right for a regional camp in Central America:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The local WordPress communities have also experienced an exponential growth. In the last five years the local WordPress Meetup groups have increased fivefold. Moreover, the collaboration between the Central American communities is more active than ever; sharing experiences and resources, members attending events in neighboring countries, giving talks and volunteering in WordCamps.</p>\n<p>This can be explained not only by the relative closeness of our countries, but also by the shared culture, values and identity of the Central American people.</p>\n<p>We believe that hosting a Central American WordCamp will further strengthen the bonds between the local communities and give birth to new initiatives and collaborations between the local WordPress Meetup groups.</p></blockquote>\n<p>San José, Costa Rica, has the largest local WordPress community with more than 2,000 meetup members and 750 attendees at recent WordCamps. Managua, Nicaragua, the second largest community, was selected as the first host city due to its central location, direct flights from all major cities in the region, and wide availability of bus services. It is also one of the most affordable capital cities in the region and does not require visas for citizens of other Central American countries.</p>\n<p>Organizers are planning a three-day event, beginning with Contributor Day, with four tracks during the main conference days. They are eyeing early October 2020 to avoid conflicts with other WordCamps that are frequently attended by the local community.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Central America&#8217;s proposal has not yet been officially submitted but if it is approved, the event would be a strong addition to the region&#8217;s growing technology sector. It also has the potential to expand and amalgamate the local communities through shared knowledge and experience.</p>\n<p>If you want to get involved, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qa_-bHMtTY1JTwHxxa28Xutg2vpaB4A7A2J9t4pXkDs/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> in progress and <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/wpcentroamerica/shared_invite/enQtNjQ4MzYwMzEzNjAzLTA4NDk4NzE5ZDNiZjlkYmYyN2Q5ODczMjhlYzVkNjkzZTQ0OGMzOTdmYWZlYTgzNWJhMDlkY2M5MTAwZTg0MTk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">join the dedicated Slack workspace</a> to participate in discussions.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 18:46:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: WP Super Cache 1.6.9 Patches Security Issue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91905\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-super-cache-1-6-9-patches-security-issue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1027:\"<p>There&#8217;s a new release of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/#developers\">WP Super Cache (1.6.9) available</a> that <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2019/07/25/wp-super-cache-1-6-9-security-update/\">patches a security issue</a> discovered in the debug log.

The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KGuI0UmpMw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">28-minute tutorial</a> covers the basics of setting up a bare bones React application that uses WPGraphQL to query ACF data.</p>\n<p>Young begins by installing four plugins: <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphiQL</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Custom Fields</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for ACF</a>. He demonstrates how to use WPGraphiQL, which provides a GraphiQL IDE inside the WordPress admin, to test GraphQL queries before adding them to the app and check to ensure ACF data is being queried.</p>\n<p>Young gave a walkthrough of installing <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Create React App</a> to quickly get a simple app up and running. When <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/chap8d/i_made_a_crash_course_on_headless_wordpress_with/eurfkrr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">asked on Reddit</a> why he didn&#8217;t use Next.js or Gatsby, he said he just wanted to present the concept with something that might already be familiar to developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I were going to launch this into production I would use Gatsby,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In this tutorial I used CRA since it’s a very simple install and I figured most people have used it before. I’ll eventually do a more in-depth and real-world example in the future. But I hope this video helps people understand the basic concept of using WP as a Headless CMS.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Young has produced 18 videos since launching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8eV_x9GaQhcoL4rexOJpXg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPCasts on YouTube</a> in March 2019. Although the channel has a corresponding website with more videos available for monthly and yearly subscribers, Young said he thinks it is important to release some introductory content for free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am a self-taught developer who relied heavily on YouTube, blogs, and individual developers creating free learning material (Chris Coyier, Wes Bos, etc.),&#8221; he said. &#8220;So by creating free content, I feel like I can help developers who are just starting out and need those resources just like I did.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Young&#8217;s day job at <a href=\"https://www.clearlink.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Clearlink</a> involves managing about approximately 20 WordPress sites with different purposes and features. He said he hopes to move these sites to a headless setup over the next few years.</p>\n<p>His WPCasts project is still very new but Young said he has received helpful feedback from the community that he is incorporating into future videos. The headless WordPress crash course tutorial seemed to hit at the right time when these setups are gaining popularity. His tutorial has been enthusiastically received, passing 600 views on YouTube in less than 24 hours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like Headless WordPress is the future of WP development,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;With powerful frameworks like Gatsby and Next, we have the best of both worlds &#8211; a fast and extendible frontend, and a CMS that has proven itself year after year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With tools like WPGraphQL, ACF, and others, WordPress will be my tool of choice for the foreseeable future. I hope that the tutorials I&#8217;ve made and future tutorials will help others see the power of WordPress and break the misconception that WordPress is &#8216;just a blogging platform.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 20:07:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 361 – Introduction to the IndieWeb With David Shanske\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91889&preview=true&preview_id=91889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-361-introduction-to-the-indieweb-with-david-shanske\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1793:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://david.shanske.com/\">David Shanske</a>.

Jason Bahl, creator and maintainer of the <a href=\"https://www.wpgraphql.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL</a> project, released the extension in April 2019 with a pricing tier ranging from $49/annually (for one site&#8217;s support) to lifetime subscription options.</p>\n<p>Bahl created the plugin with the hopes of generating enough revenue to one day fund his efforts working on WPGraphQL full-time. Now that he has <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jason-bahl-joins-the-gatsby-team-to-work-on-wpgraphql-full-time\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">joined the Gatsby team to work full time on WPGraphQL</a>, he has the time and resources to make the ACF extension available for free.</p>\n<p>The plugin allows developers to interact with their ACF data using GraphQL queries. It works with both the free and pro versions of <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ACF</a> and WPGraphQL v0.3.2 or newer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I first started working on the core WPGraphQL plugin, I thought it would be awesome to have meta fields automatically exposed to the WPGraphQL Schema,&#8221; Bahl said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since WordPress core doesn&#8217;t have a fields API, developers turn to plugins such as Advanced Custom Fields, Metabox.io, CMB2, Carbon Fields, Field Manager, or one of the many other metabox solutions for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>ACF is by far the most popular among these solutions with more than a million active installs. (Metabox.io has roughly half the user base with 400,000+ installs and CMB2 is the next most popular at an estimated 200,000 installs). Bahl started working towards supporting ACF a few years ago but didn&#8217;t have a production use case for it and left it untouched until demand for the plugin increased.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the latter half of 2018 and early 2019 I got many requests via Slack, Twitter, and Github for a quality ACF extension, and I also noticed the top search terms on the WPGraphQL website were &#8216;ACF&#8217; and &#8216;Advanced Custom Fields,&#8217; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I initially wanted to release the plugin as a free plugin, but there&#8217;s only so much I can do for free. Maintaining WPGraphQL on the side of my full-time job was already time consuming and I thought if I was making income I could support it better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since the plugin&#8217;s initial release on April 19, Bahl reports there have been 85 licenses purchased, which enabled him to devote more time to the project. Now that he is no longer attempting to self-sustain his projects, he and the Gatsby team decided the best course of action would be to make it free so that more of the community can benefit from the project. He anticipates being able to provide the same level of support since the plugin&#8217;s launch with more of his time allocated to focusing on the WPGraphQL ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Performance is the most common reason that necessitates developers using ACF to implement WPGraphQL on their sites. It offers staggering performance gains over using the WP REST API to query ACF data, as shown in the example below:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Good call. . .I need to market the performance side better. . .here\'s an example of a REST API call using ACF to REST API and using WPGraphQL for ACF to select specific fields. </p>\n<p>*REST:* 24.8 KB, 1.22s<br />*GraphQL*: 1010 b, 377ms (not even 1kb payload!!!) <a href=\"https://t.co/0qS52bvlEY\">pic.twitter.com/0qS52bvlEY</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; GraphQL for WordPress (@wpgraphql) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpgraphql/status/1119309324646359040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 19, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;When developers try to build &#8220;headless&#8221; applications with WordPress, they often run into pain points with the WP REST API, and they turn to WPGraphQL to ease those pains,&#8221; Bahl said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many developers were registering ACF fields to their WPGraphQL Schema by hand, and that can be a tedious process if you have hundreds of fields. A plugin like WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields saves developers a lot of development time, and allows them to take advantage of the features of GraphQL that make headless WordPress development a pleasant experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and support and feature requests are handled through <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf/issues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Github issues</a>. The plugin is also <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on packagist.org</a> for those who want to include it in projects using Composer.</p>\n<p>Developers with general questions can join the <a href=\"https://wpgql-slack.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Slack workspace</a> or the project&#8217;s online community on <a href=\"https://spectrum.chat/wpgraphql\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spectrum</a>.

Both of us were not the highest scoring students but we were the most active ones. For our major project rather than building just anything, he wanted us to build a PBX software that our college needed and was already paying for to an outside vendor.</p>\n<p>It was a difficult one, we didn&#8217;t know it was possible to make Phone calls from the browser. My friend and I spent the next 3 months researching and building the software. When we were about to deploy it, we realize that the software won&#8217;t talk to the driver of the PRI card. Only 15 days were left for the final exams and if we didn&#8217;t build the project on time, it would never see the light of the sun.</p>\n<p>We spend every waking hour on the software for the next 7 days and made it work. When it worked, our HOD used that software to call the Chairman of college, he congratulated us and we got the best project award for that. It was the moment when I said to myself, if I can pull this off, I can do anything and promised myself to do something significant in the world of computers.</p>\n<h3>Hello WordPress</h3>\n<p>It was 2012, the time when Web was taking over the World, desktop applications were being replaced by websites, and HTML, CSS and jQuery were becoming more and more powerful.</p>\n<p>I would spend hours and hours sitting in front of my desktop learning and playing with these technologies. My parents used to think that I was always wasting my time all day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My dad was convinced that I’d join him in his business because I wasn’t good enough for anything else.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One day, I saw a post of my Facebook Friend. He wanted someone to build a website for him. I contacted him and gave him an estimate, he agreed and that was my first web project. The project was completed successfully and I got the payment. My confidence was in the sky.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I got another project. This time it was a big one, an ecommerce website. I spent 4 months working on that and completed it successfully but I realized it was a lot of work and the pay was not good enough.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know WordPress back then but I knew there would be something that would make developing websites easier. A few months later when I checked WordPress, I was blown away to see the capabilities of this CMS. Adding features like Login with Facebook, Shopping cart, Contact Form, Captcha would only take a few minutes. The things which would take a day or even a week were as simple as installing a plugin and configuring the settings.</p>\n<p>I realized that the e-commerce project that I built on core PHP could have been done within 15 days if I had chosen WordPress. It was a win-win for me as my clients. Since then, WordPress is my de facto choice for all web projects.</p>\n<h3>About Today..</h3>\n<p>I’m an Independent WordPress contractor. I work on designing and implementing web pages, themes and plugins for WordPress, helping clients to troubleshoot and fix their WordPress websites, designing themes that are as functional as they are beautiful, working with startups to quickly set up their MVP, and developing websites for corporates which reflect their brand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m leading a happy and balanced life. I’m content, I have a great set of customers. I have the liberty to change my working hours to manage time for my hobbies and family.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sure I don’t make as much money as a CEO but I do have a balanced and happy life. And it does sound exciting but the path wasn’t all easy. In this article, I try to give my best advice which I learned the hard way and I so much wish someone had told me about all this when I was getting started.</p>\n<h3>1. Be a specialist</h3>\n<p>General Physicians don’t make as much money as specialists make. The world is huge, even a small field like Software Engineering is too big that you can’t master everything in it.</p>\n<p>You have to be the greatest in your field if you want to charge a premium amount. You need to be someone who has encountered and fixed every possible problem in that field. You should know your thing like the back of your hand. AND to be able to get there you need to find your thing and be very specific about it. You need to say NO to everything else.</p>\n<p>It sounds obvious and easy, right? It isn’t. I can bet that 90% of the people out there are not doing this. I’d say It is not their fault. We, humans, are curious creatures and we get bored easily, that is why when we see a new shiny technology we want to learn that.</p>\n<p>This is in our nature but our nature is keeping us from achieving greatness. You want to be great at something, be ready to embrace boredom and put in thousands of hours of practice.</p>\n<p>“Pick your niche and say no to everything else”</p>\n<h3>2. Understand that not every job is for you.</h3>\n<p>Someone on amazon is selling 1500 Live Ladybugs and what shocks me more is the fact that someone is even buying them. But, we shouldn’t be all judgemental because everything has a buyer and everything has a seller.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ladybugs.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>When I had started freelancing on Upwork, I’d also get in the race-to-the-bottom along with the other freelancers who were willing to work for literally $3/h. I’d think that it will never be possible for me to get away from this race and making good money.</p>\n<p>It took me years, I had to work with many bad client projects for peanuts to realize that I’m a different product and I need a different buyer.</p>\n<p>I increased my rates 8 times and dedicated myself to give the best possible service I can to my clients. What happened next shook my whole belief system. Not only people were paying me the premium amount, I was getting more customers. As you go up there is lesser competition.</p>\n<h3>3. Not everyone who gives you money is your client. Some client might suck the joy out of work. Stay far away from them.</h3>\n<p>Let’s be honest, there are some people that we don’t like and there are some people who don’t like us. If you were in a job, there would be no choice but to bear with the irrational and arrogant boss of yours but thank god, you are a freelancer. You have the liberty to choose the people you want to work with.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the best thing you can do is say NO even if that means you have to lose money.</p>\n<h3>4. Know your worth and charge that much:</h3>\n<p>Imagine, if you are in a public place and a stranger comes up to you and asks you to buy his $5 bill for $1. What would you think? Most of us will not buy that $5 bill even if it is a great deal, you are getting an extra $4 in the exchange. Because we are hardwired to believe that all too-good-to-be-true deals are scams.</p>\n<p>While setting your hourly rates, it is important to make sure that you are charging a correct amount. Lowballing isn’t helpful for those clients which you want to work with. The right clients are the probably the businessmen who know that to get good work you have to spend good money and they are there to spend the money. Are you able to do the good work?</p>\n<h3>5. Experience what your client is experiencing; think what your client is thinking</h3>\n<p>I’m a web developer and I do need help from other freelancers at times to deliver my project. I hire the best freelancers on Upwork for my job and I notice everything that they do. I notice their way of sending the proposals, their way of presenting the work, their way of negotiation when I, as a client, ask for more free work.</p>\n<p>This activity will help you learn that there are so many things which you think are right in your head are so incorrect and can be so much better.</p>\n<h3>6. Don’t sell technologies, sell solutions</h3>\n<blockquote><p>“People don&#8217;t want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole.”<br />\nTheodore Levitt</p></blockquote>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be a React Developer, Photoshop Designer or Final Cut Pro Editor. Be a problem solver. Nobody hires a writer because he can use MS Word, a writer is hired because he can write persuasive writing. The copy that can convert visitors to customers. You need the ability to sell solutions, not technology.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Becoming A Successful WordPress Freelancer In India\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Becoming%20A%20Successful%20WordPress%20Freelancer%20In%20India&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-a-successful-wordpress-freelancer-in-india%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Becoming A Successful WordPress Freelancer In India\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-a-successful-wordpress-freelancer-in-india%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-a-successful-wordpress-freelancer-in-india%2F&title=Becoming+A+Successful+WordPress+Freelancer+In+India\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Becoming A Successful WordPress Freelancer In India\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-a-successful-wordpress-freelancer-in-india/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/072419-min-150x150.jpg&description=Becoming A Successful WordPress Freelancer In India\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Becoming A Successful WordPress Freelancer In India\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-a-successful-wordpress-freelancer-in-india/\" title=\"Becoming A Successful WordPress Freelancer In India\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-a-successful-wordpress-freelancer-in-india/\">Becoming A Successful WordPress Freelancer In India</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:29:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Pramod Jodhani\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Asia Set for February 21-23, 2020, in Bangkok, Thailand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91775\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-asia-set-for-february-21-23-2020-in-bangkok-thailand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2041:\"<p>The first ever <a href=\"https://2020.asia.wordcamp.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Asia</a> has launched a teaser website and announced February 21-23, 2020, as the dates for the event.

Nowell gave a presentation at WordCamp Europe 2019 about <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/using-blocks-outside-the-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">using blocks outside the editor</a>, including on the frontend. Block Comments is one example he brought to life using the block list component along with some wrapper components.</p>\n<p>The result is a comment form that offers the same UI as the WordPress editor but with a limited set of blocks appropriate for commenting and no block sidebar panel. This includes text-based and embed blocks, along with image upload via URL. It defaults to the paragraph block when the commenter clicks inside the form. Here is an example of using the block editor for a reply on the Twenty Nineteen theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-23-at-12.39.28-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>For the most part, Block Comments should fit in with the style of the active theme, as shown below with an example using the Astrid theme. Nowell recommends users watch out for occasional clashes between the editor UI CSS and the theme&#8217;s CSS, since it is still early beta software.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-23-at-12.44.17-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Incorporating the block editor into commenting could make formatting easier for commenters with more options for expressing themselves. The plugin includes blocks for lists, quotes, code, embeds, headings, pre-formatted text, and other formats, all with Gutenberg&#8217;s built in preview. Commenters can immediately see how the comment will appear without having to struggle with using the correct format tags.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see it as a much more flexible form of those Tiny MCE visual comment forms,&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;Except instead of just putting a toolbar on top and showing you bold and italic in-line, you can do more.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-23-at-1.00.12-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Nowell said replies and threading work exactly the same with Block Comments enabled. The UI for the comment form is the only thing that changes, but the commenting system remains the same.</p>\n<p>Bringing the block editor to comments is not yet on WordPress&#8217; roadmap. The UI is different from the comment forms users have become accustomed to over the years of commenting on the internet. Some commenters may find it confusing if this is their first experience with WordPress&#8217; block editor. For those who have used WordPress 5.0+ previously, the Gutenberg-powered comment form brings a little more unity to the front and backend posting experiences.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s certainly not for every comment form, but I can see it being very useful in some situations, such as P2 blogs,&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;As Gutenberg itself improves, it will too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Block Comments is currently <a href=\"https://github.com/tomjn/block-comments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a> where users can report any issues or conflicts. It is recommended to be used with the Gutenberg plugin installed for best results. It also doesn&#8217;t play well with the Classic Editor plugin, since that plugin removes the block editor hooks and styles.</p>\n<p>I would not be surprised to see this experiment further developed for P2-powered blogs or even Jetpack comments , if the idea catches on. These avenues would provide a good testing ground for such a feature before it might be considered for WordPress core.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 20:35:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 4.4.0 Security and Maintenance release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=307083\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://buddypress.org/2019/07/buddypress-4-4-0-security-and-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1228:\"<p>BuddyPress 4.4.0 is now available.

Kids events focus on teaching children how to become content creators, creative thinkers, and even business owners. Numerous repeat attendees have morphed their personal blogs into businesses and these kids are only 8-13 years old. Kids events provide an opportunity for local communities to foster long term community growth. These events also offer opportunities for a more diverse event in that kids bring a new perspective to any event. WordPress and its surrounding communities have the opportunity to change the lives of kids all over the world.</p>\n<h2>History of Kids Events</h2>\n<p>The history of Kids Events is full of many Heroes who have worked tirelessly to ensure that children in our community are included in events. Most of these events happen in tandem with WordCamps, but that is not always the case. Here is the history of most of the Kids Events and the Heroes behind them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2010-03-06 &#8211; Kilkenny, Ireland &#8211; Sabrina Dent<a href=\"https://www.krishna.me/wordcamp-ireland-in-kilkenny-has-its-own-kids-camp/\"> https://www.krishna.me/wordcamp-ireland-in-kilkenny-has-its-own-kids-camp/</a></li>\n<li>2011-01-29 &#8211; Phoenix, AZ &#8211; Abbie Sanderson<a href=\"https://2015.dfw.wordcamp.org/2015/07/06/announcing-wordcamp-for-kids/\"> https://2015.dfw.wordcamp.org/2015/07/06/announcing-wordcamp-for-kids/</a></li>\n<li>2013-01-20 &#8211; Phoenix &#8211; Natalie MacLees<a href=\"https://2013.phoenix.wordcamp.org/schedule/sunday/\"> https://2013.phoenix.wordcamp.org/schedule/sunday/</a></li>\n<li>2013-04-06 &#8211; Miami</li>\n<li>2014-05-11 &#8211; Miami &#8211; Tammy Lister and Sarah Gooding <a href=\"https://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-miami-kids-workshop/\"> https://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-miami-kids-workshop/</a></li>\n<li>2014-01-19 &#8211; Phoenix &#8211; Bernice Lee and Andy Christian<a href=\"https://2014.phoenix.wordcamp.org/session/wordcamp-kids/\"> https://2014.phoenix.wordcamp.org/session/wordcamp-kids/</a></li>\n<li>2014-03-15 &#8211; Atlanta &#8211; Syed Balkhi, Sara Cannon, Micah Wood, and Russell Fair <a href=\"https://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org/kidscamp-atlanta/\"> https://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org/kidscamp-atlanta/</a></li>\n<li>2015-03-15 &#8211; St Louis &#8211; Russell Fair, Chris Koerner, Lucas Lima, Eric Juden, Michele Butcher-Jones <a href=\"https://2015.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/kids-camp/\">https://2015.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/kids-camp/</a></li>\n<li>2015-03-27 &#8211; Atlanta, GA &#8211; Russell Fair<a href=\"https://2015.atlanta.wordcamp.org/\"> https://2015.atlanta.wordcamp.org/</a></li>\n<li>2015-05-31 &#8211; Miami FL Nikhil V, Sarrah Vesselov, Shawn Hooper and Michele Butcher-Jones. <a href=\"https://2015.miami.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-for-kids-tickets-now-available/\">https://2015.miami.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-for-kids-tickets-now-available/</a></li>\n<li>2016-02-20 &#8211; Miami, FL &#8211; Sandy Edwards, Kimberly Lipari, Michele Butcher-Jones, Shawn Hooper,  and Chris Christoff <a href=\"https://2016.miami.wordcamp.org/2016/02/05/details-on-weekend-kids-activities/#workshop\">https://2016.miami.wordcamp.org/2016/02/05/details-on-weekend-kids-activities/#workshop</a></li>\n<li>2016-09-26 &#8211; Dallas/Ft.

The programs offer events, workshops, and inclusion in the ever-growing WordPress community.</p>\n<p>The community as a whole has always provided educational and networking events to further personal development. Kids Programming is no different.</p>\n<p>Events focus on key skill sets such as public speaking, writing, networking, and communication. Children get to work with peers in exciting and fulfilling ways and leave the events with new friends. These friends often live in various places around the globe and create the opportunity for long-distance friendships fostered through technological resources.</p>\n<p>For example, my son lives in Orlando and has friends in Tampa, Jacksonville and even out of state. He keeps in touch through Facebook Messenger or Slack.</p>\n<p>The fact is our kids need a fun way to use real-world skills in a non-threatening environment. A place where they won’t be tested and where they can’t fail.</p>\n<p>These programs offer just that. With over 40 different volunteers helping to foster this program across the globe it is becoming a WordPress community staple.</p>\n<p>There is still much to do. Safety has to be our #1 priority when working with minors and that means keeping things pretty consistent. There is a group of amazing volunteers documenting the process of planning a kids event and class curriculum.</p>\n<p>The team is working on checklists and curriculum to make it super easy for a meetup chapter or WordCamp to add a kids event or kids program to their offering.</p>\n<p>The future for these programs is looking very bright. There is ever-growing interested in events, and more people wanting to be part of the kids&#8217; event revolution.</p>\n<p>You too can be a hero. We need more people to write, edit, translate and test these programs. No experience is necessary and you don’t have to love kids either. This initiative allows so many children from different backgrounds and walks of life to be included in a super caring community. We see kids whose parents are already in the community and also kids who otherwise would never know the community exists. Your time is going to help create the next generation of WordPress!

Newspack is a collection of themes, plugins, and features geared towards newsrooms such as revenue generation wizards, mobile delivery, and search engine optimization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Beatty, head of Newspack Communication says they&#8217;re seeking up to 50 newsrooms to be part of phase two which lasts from September 1st &#8211; February 29th, 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What you’ll get: a new Newspack website, including the migration of your existing site; free hosting, security, updates, backups and support on WordPress.com through February 2020; membership in the Newspack community of users; access to Newspack developers; exclusive performance benchmarking against your peers; and more,&#8221; Beatty said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations that are selected are expected to provide feedback, test new features, and help shape the overall direction of the platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free hosting for charter members will expire on February 29th, 2020. News organizations with revenue under $500K can expect to pay $1,000 per month and organizations that generate revenue of over $500K will pay $2,000 per month. Newspack is currently in negotiations to provide subsidies for organizations that encounter difficulties with the pricing structure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those interested in participating in the charter program have until August 15th to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPF-XEbRDoOmSyGBYCyQZgleFcXNNnJExZCd9bsjw93jAXRg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1\">fill out the application</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 20:36:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It – Issue 28\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91699&preview=true&preview_id=91699\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-28\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7685:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50955\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039\">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">(license)</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn’t make it into a full post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Changes to WordPress PHP Coding Standards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on changes that were <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/26/coding-standards-updates-for-php-5-6/\">proposed back in March</a>, the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/\">PHP Coding Standards</a> for WordPress have been altered. Note that these changes apply to WordPress core only and Gary Pendergast recommends that developers can and should choose practices that best suit your needs for plugins and themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/07/12/php-coding-standards-changes/\">PHP Coding Standards Changes</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Excluding Remote Employee Job Applicants Based on the State They Live In</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Brad, the topic of not hiring job applicants for a remote company based on the state they live in because of tax laws is not something I&#8217;ve seen discussed. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A really interesting topic around remote companies, and one I haven\'t seen talked about much, is the idea of \"stateism\". Basically, not hiring from certain states because of their heavy handed laws (usually tax related). There are a few states I\'d rather avoid at this point.</p>&mdash; Brad Williams (@williamsba) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba/status/1149727445450481664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2019</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In certain situations, companies that go the extra mile to hire a remote worker can also turn that person into an advocate. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Interesting. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpengine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@wpengine</a> had to jump through some additional hoops to employ me remotely as a Canadian and I think that shows what a good employer they are and makes me advocate for them more. Worth thinking about beyond purely financial considerations.</p>&mdash; Chris Garrett (@chrisgarrett) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisgarrett/status/1149729535782318081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2019</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re involved in the hiring process for a remote company, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on this topic in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Would You Like to See A Product Hunt for WordPress Products?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you create something awesome in the WordPress ecosystem, it&#8217;s tough to get the word out. Ben from LyrWP wants to know if anyone is interested in a <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/\">Product Hunt</a> website for Themes, Plugins, and Services. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Would anyone be interested in a Producthunt purely for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> themes, plugins and services? I think this needs doing. It\'s hard for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/developers?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#developers</a> to get the products they slave over out there without costing a bomb in marketing. Anybody else interested in this happening?</p>&mdash; Ben (@lyrwp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lyrwp/status/1149693535949590529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2019</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s a great idea and something I&#8217;d like to see become a reality. There are probably a ton of great products in the WordPress space that go unseen because there&#8217;s no easy way to reach a large mass of people outside of sites like the Tavern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Mario Peshev is concerned that such a site may end up posting infrequently or promote mediocre products. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I don\'t disagree with your stance.

Inspired by a conversation with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a> at WordCamp Europe, Arntz created the plugin to &#8220;explore what the theming of tomorrow could look like already today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Block Areas allows users to define specific areas where they want to use the block editor (outside of regular posts). The block areas function similar to widget areas, but are created using a custom post type with a familiar admin UI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/block-areas-admin-page.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;They are implemented as a post type – with the key aspect that they can’t be accessed in the frontend via a certain URL, but your theme has to render them via a block_areas()->render( $slug ) method that the plugin exposes,&#8221; Arntz said. &#8220;The slug you pass to the method should match the block area slug (i.e. post slug) of one of the areas you have created in the admin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plugin comes with block areas for site header and footer to provide a starting point. However, adding the block areas to a theme is one technical hurdle that currently limits this experimental plugin to developers.</p>\n<p>The concept is reminiscent of the now seemingly abandoned <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buckets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Buckets</a> plugin that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buckets-a-wordpress-widgets-alternative-for-placing-content-anywhere\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">aimed to provide an alternative to WordPress widgets</a>. It allows admins to create reusable pieces of content and place them anywhere on their sites. Reusable buckets can be created with the same UI as the legacy post editor and then placed anywhere using a shortcode or via a button in the TinyMCE editor.</p>\n<p>In the case of Buckets, the idea was to preserve the users&#8217; ability to create content using the visual editor and media manager. Block Areas seems to have a similar aim &#8211; to preserve users&#8217; ability to use the block editor anywhere they want throughout the site. That is part of the general goal of Gutenberg Phase 2, which includes migrating widgets and menus to use the block editor.</p>\n<p>Block Areas is just one idea for providing a unified approach to reusable content inside WordPress. It is not an official project and may not be the approach that the Gutenberg team settles on for core. However, it offers a good opportunity for discussion and collaboration about the possibilities of taking the editor sitewide. This will open up a whole new genre of blocks for plugin developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Think about a block that renders the site title, the custom header, a menu, the copyright information – taking Gutenberg to the site level opens up a whole new set of typical blocks that would be required,&#8221; Arntz said. &#8220;Start thinking about which blocks you would need outside of your post content bubble today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/wprig/block-areas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Areas</a> plugin is available on GitHub if you want to experiment with it.

He works for ServMask Inc and is responsible for the Quality Assurance process for All-in-One WP Migration plugin. <br /><br />He believes in the Buddhist teaching that “the most valuable service is one rendered to our fellow humans,” and his contributions demonstrates this through his WordPress translation work and multi-lingual support projects for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?fit=632%2C474&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7023\" />Bhutanese contributors to the Dzongkha locale on WordPress Translation Day\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Ugyen started his career with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2016, Ugyen was looking for a new job after his former cloud company ran into financial difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview he was asked many questions about WordPress and, although he had a basic understanding of WordPress, he struggled to give detailed answers. After that interview he resolved to develop his skills and learn as much about WordPress as he could.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months passed and he received a call from ServMask Inc, who had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration. They offered him a position, fulfilling his wish to work with WordPress full-time. And because of that, Ugyen is now an active contributor to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordCamp Bangkok 2018</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Bangkok 2018 was a turning point event for Ugyen. WordCamps are a great opportunity to meet WordPress community members you don’t otherwise get to know, and he was able to attend his first WordCamp through the sponsorship of his company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first day of WordCamp Bangkok was a Contributor Day, where people volunteer to work together to contribute to the development of WordPress. Ugyen joined the Community team to have conversations with WordPress users from all over the world. He was able to share his ideas for supporting new speakers, events and organizers to help build the WordPress community in places where it is not yet booming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the main day of the event, Ugyen managed a photo booth for speakers, organizers, and attendees to capture their memories of WordCamp.&nbsp;He also got to take some time out to attend several presentations during the conference. What particularly stuck in Ugyen’s mind was learning that having a website content plan has been shown to lead to 100% growth in business development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Co-Organizing<strong> Thimphu</strong>&#8216;s <strong>WordPress Meetup</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After attending WordCamp Bangkok 2018 as well as a local Meetup event, Ugyen decided to&nbsp;introduce WordPress to his home country and cities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the WordPress Translation Day organizers, he realized that his local language, Dzongkha, was not as fully translated as other languages in the WordPress Core Translation. That is when Ugyen knew that he wanted to help build his local community. He organized Thimphu’s first WordPress Meetup to coincide with WordPress Translation Day 4, and it was a huge success!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all WordPress Meetups, the Thimpu WordPress Meetup is an easygoing, volunteer-organized, non-profit meetup which covers everything related to WordPress.

Serious problems seem to generate unhelpfully broad and exaggerated headlines, like Alexis Madrigal at <em>The Atlantic </em>describing &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-politicians-and-scholars-turned-against-big-tech/591052/\">the coalition out to kill tech as we know it</a>.&#8221; He provides a good breakdown of the many interest groups and the perspectives in play, however, from Antitrust Theorists to Shoshana Zuboff, who coined the term &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook\">surveillance capitalism</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Writer and Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler says the internet is becoming a &#8220;dark forest&#8221; as people retreat to &#8220;wild&#8221; spaces.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Madrigal is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/facebook-and-youtubes-platform-excuse-dying/591466/\">probably right</a> that people are tired of hearing that publishing platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have no role in policing &#8220;provably false information&#8221; posted by their users. <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/free-speech-privacy-and-web/\">Brian predicted this</a> several years ago before WordPress.com <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/new-wordpress-policy-allows-it-to-shut-down-blogs-of-sandy-hook-deniers/\">came under pressure</a> to shut down sites denying the Sandy Hook school shooting ever happened. Now the boundaries of acceptable content are more actively guarded but not consistently or well, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">in some cases like Facebook</a> or YouTube, if the cure is human moderation, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa\">it&#8217;s as bad as the disease</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Google product manager and <a href=\"https://humanetech.com/\">Center for Humane Technology</a> founder Tristan Harris is near the top of Madrigal&#8217;s list of tech-killers. Harris <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-is-how-youre-being-manipulated-1835853810\">recently testified</a> before the US Senate with <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/6/optimizing-for-engagement-understanding-the-use-of-persuasive-technology-on-internet-platforms\">such stark examples of manipulative interfaces</a> that one senator said he was thankful he would &#8220;be dead and gone &#8230; when  all this shit comes to fruition.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Harris is good at generating outrage by publicizing truly outrageous things Google, Facebook, and others are doing, it&#8217;s not always clear what he thinks should be done. Does protecting our attention, or children&#8217;s developing brains, or democracy itself require platforms to police themselves or be policed by someone else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to Harris, Pinboard owner and widely read blogger Maciej Ceglowski made a less dramatic but similarly urgent <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Ceglowski%20Testimony%205-7-19.pdf\">statement</a> about privacy and data collection to the Senate back in May. (<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm\">Web version and video link</a>.) A more recent post on Ceglowski&#8217;s blog called &#8220;<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2019/06/the_new_wilderness.htm\">The New Wilderness</a>&#8221; argues we need laws protecting the digital environment from surveillance, so it retains a &#8220;wilderness&#8221; of &#8220;ambient privacy.&#8221; Like Harris, Ceglowski focuses on Facebook and Google as &#8220;the world’s most sophisticated dragnet surveillance operation, a duopoly that rakes in nearly two-thirds of the money spent on online ads.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with Ceglowski&#8217;s imagery, writer and Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler says <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1\">the internet is becoming a &#8220;dark forest&#8221;</a> as people retreat to &#8220;wild&#8221; spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strickler isn&#8217;t talking about &#8220;wild&#8221; spaces on the web that offer unmoderated, possibly objectionable content; he means areas without algorithms that keep <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/unpopular-content-schwartz\">&#8220;unpopular&#8221; material</a> out of our monetized attention:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem Strickler sees with our retreat from the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; parts of the internet is the possibility of their discredit and loss. We may already be past that point, <a href=\"https://taibbi.substack.com/p/russiagate-is-wmd-times-a-million\">as Matt Taibbi has argued about the press</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Doctorow has been working this beat for a long time and has some excellent, recent contributions to the debate:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A discussion of <a href=\"https://corecursive.com/33-cory-doctorow-digital-rights/\">monopolies and why software has power</a> on the CoRecursive podcast with Adam Gordon Bell. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"🎙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li><li>A contribution to the <em>New York Times&#8217;</em> “Op-Eds From the Future” series with a piece called “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/opinion/future-free-speech-social-media-platforms.html\">I Shouldn’t Have to Publish This in The New York Times</a>.” <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f4f0.png\" alt=\"📰\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctorow&#8217;s Op-Ed from the future comes from a time &#8220;in which we have decided to solve the problems of Big Tech by making them liable for what their users say and do.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this possible future:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>[A]ll our speech is vetted by algorithms that delete anything that looks like misinformation, harassment, copyright infringement, incitement to terrorism, etc — with the result that the only place where you can discuss anything of import is newspapers themselves. [<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/planet/feed/#note-1\">1</a>]</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctorow describes the alternative to picking media winners and tech losers <a href=\"https://craphound.com/news/2019/06/24/i-shouldnt-have-to-publish-this-in-the-new-york-times-my-op-ed-from-the-future/\">on his blog</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We can either try to fix Big Tech (by making it use its monopoly profits to clean up its act) or we can fix the internet (by breaking them up and denying them access to monopoly profits) — but we can’t do both.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what Option A (self-regulation) would look like or how it could help, which is partly Doctorow&#8217;s point. If Option B (trust-busting) happens, it would probably leave a lot more space for wild things to grow. But even in the shadow of Big Tech monopolies, WordPress and other mature open source ecosystems still represent their antithesis, like a vast network of old-growth forests connected to small stands of young saplings. That analogy reminds me of <a href=\"https://mor10.com/wordpress-the-15-year-revolution/\">Morten Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s reflections on WordPress&#8217;s 15th anniversary</a> and his hope that his &#8220;son will be building his own web experiences using software that traces its roots back to [WordPress].&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wild, biodiverse forest image is a good one for us because it is an image of social, interdependent, and very different individuals. Peter Wohlleben&#8217;s book on <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em> could just as easily describe the cooperative, distributive, and passionately interconnected, democratic nature of open source communities at their best:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When trees grow together, nutrients and water can be optimally divided among them all so that each tree can grow into the best tree it can be. If you &#8220;help&#8221; individual trees by getting rid of their supposed competition, the remaining trees are bereft. They send messages out to their neighbors in vain, because nothing remains but stumps. Every tree now muddles along on its own, giving rise to great differences in productivity. Some individuals photosynthesize like mad until sugar positively bubbles along their trunk. As a result, they are fit and grow better, but they aren&#8217;t particularly long-lived. This is because a tree can be only as strong as the forest that surrounds it. And there are now a lot of losers in the forest. Weaker members, who would once have been supported by the stronger ones, suddenly fall behind. Whether the reason for their decline is their location and lack of nutrients, a  passing malaise, or genetic makeup, they now fall prey to insects and fungi.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the giants are in trouble if they are the last trees standing. Wohlleben explains they will end up presiding over a barren desert where little more than weeds can survive:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that how evolution works?&#8221; you ask. The survival of the fittest? Their well-being depends on their community, and when the supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well. When that happens, the forest is no longer a single closed unit. Hot sun and swirling winds can now penetrate to the forest floor and disrupt the moist, cool climate. Even strong trees get sick a lot over the course of their lives. When this happens, they depend on their weaker neighbors for support. If they are no longer there, then all it takes is what would once have been a harmless insect attack to seal the fate even of giants.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If we maintain open source communities that are accessible and inclusive  <br /> — for big and small, young and old, established businesses and new ones — then we are doing our part to keep the web wild and healthy. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f3de.png\" alt=\"🏞\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a id=\"note-1\" href=\"https://medium.com/whither-news/news-publishers-go-to-war-with-the-internet-and-we-all-lose-cc8aca5336f5\">Jeff Jarvis thinks that&#8217;s what newspapers want</a> — a &#8220;war with the internet,&#8221; i.e. the major platform providers — out of the hope this might restore their previous command of advertising and attention.

JAMstack is a term coined by <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netlify</a> CEO Mathias Biilmann to describe development architecture that includes client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup, the three pillars of a modern static website.</p>\n<p>Static websites are making a major comeback right now, perhaps as a reaction to the slow, bloated PHP frameworks that run large portions of the web today. The speed, security, and scalability of these sites, often available at a lower cost, are some of the most compelling reasons developers find themselves joining the rapidly growing JAMstack community. It also provides a git and CLI-friendly development workflow and allows developers to easily experiment with the latest frontend technologies, without prescribing any specific frameworks or tools.</p>\n<p>Most JAMstack sites are built using Jekyll, Hugo, Nuxt, Next, Gatsby, or another <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">static site generator</a>. The generated markup and assets are often served via a CDN for near instant page loads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netlify</a> pioneered JAMstack hosting and has inspired the creation of a myriad of tools that enable fast and convenient deployments. Plugins that allow developers source content from WordPress and host it with Netlify are starting to pop up more frequently. Netlify&#8217;s free tier is one of the main reasons it has grown so quickly in popularity, as it provides a fast way to host a personal site or small project with custom domain support, HTTPS, Git integration, and continuous deployment included.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tinypixel.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Pixel Collective</a> created a plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/pixelcollective/netlify-deploy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netlify Deploy</a> that automates Netlify builds on WordPress publish and update events. The company built it to make it easier for developers to rebuild Netlify-hosted Gatsby frontends using WordPress as the publishing tool. It works in the background to keep a static frontend in sync with the post database, rebuilding the site when users make updates to posts and pages. The plugin triggers the Netlify webhook whenever the standard WordPress posttypes post and page undergo a change in publish status, but it can also be modified to work with custom post types and custom publish hooks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-jamstack-deployments/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JAMstack Deployments</a>, created by <a href=\"https://crgeary.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Geary</a>, a developer and JAMstack aficionado, is a similar WordPress plugin that facilitates deployments to Netlify, as well as other platforms. The plugin&#8217;s settings page lets users configure the webhook URL in the admin, and includes options to limit it to trigger on specific post types and taxonomies. JAMstack Deployments is also conveniently available for free on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webhook-netlify-deploy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deploy Netlify Webhook</a> is a similar plugin from <a href=\"https://lukesecomb.digital/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Secomb</a> that appears to work manually through a &#8220;Build&#8221; button in the WordPress admin. It has the added benefit of allowing developers to check the status of the latest build to see if it was successful, without having to leave WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/netlify-webhook-deploy.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://justinwhall.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Hall</a>, a plugin author and senior web developer at SendGrid, published his <a href=\"https://github.com/justinwhall/gatsby-wordpress-netlify-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby + Headless WordPress + Netlify starter skeleton</a> to GitHub. This particular setup requires his <a href=\"https://github.com/justinwhall/littlebot-netlify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LittleBot Netlify plugin</a> to trigger Netlify build hooks on post save or update, with an additional option that allows WordPress users to publish to Staging or Production sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/stage-production.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP2Static</a> is a popular plugin that generates static HTML files rom a WordPress site.

Theh plugin currently has more than 10,000 active installations.</p>\n<p>These are just a small sampling of tools that developers are creating to allow WordPress users to retain the capabilities a dynamic publishing platform while building it statically to take advantage of the speed, security, and performance gains.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I used to be afraid I was distracting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> folks by teaching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gatsbyjs</a>.</p>\n<p>Now it\'s clear WordPress devs must learn tools like Gatsby to stay relevant, and WordPress must meet headless needs to stay relevant. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LearnJavascriptDeeply?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LearnJavascriptDeeply</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LetsDoThis?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LetsDoThis</a><a href=\"https://t.co/TEJeNrFa1K\">https://t.co/TEJeNrFa1K</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/69geFKlZ9r\">https://t.co/69geFKlZ9r</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Zac Gordon (@zgordon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zgordon/status/1141392958341746689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 19, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The trend towards using a headless CMS combined with static site generators is a setup that is heavily geared towards developers at the moment. <a href=\"https://bejamas.io/blog/jamstack-for-clients/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Translating all the jargon</a> for non-technical site and business owners is a new challenge for those looking to sell services for setting up JAMstack architecture.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where more user-friendly hosting platforms like <a href=\"https://www.strattic.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Strattic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.getshifter.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shifter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hardypress.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HardyPress</a> are making inroads on marketing JAMstack technology to a less-technical crowd.

Adding contact forms can be a challenge. Sites that require native WordPress comments or anything that is more complex and interactive will not work. This includes functionality offered by WooCommerce, bbPress, BuddyPress, and membership plugins, to name a few examples. For now, the JAMstack fervor is mostly limited to the DIY developer crowd looking to host more simple sites.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 03:02:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Seeks to Curb Obtrusive Admin Notices with New Requirement to Follow Core Design Patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91604\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:138:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-seeks-to-curb-obtrusive-admin-notices-with-new-requirement-to-follow-core-design-patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3856:\"<p>For years, the WordPress admin has become increasingly overloaded with admin notices. Some of them are giant, branded notices with their own particular designs that obstruct users&#8217; activities in the admin.</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team is taking action to curb obtrusive notices that fall within its purview &#8211; those generated by themes hosted in the official directory. In the excitement of yesterday&#8217;s announcement about the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-initiates-new-long-term-plan-to-make-all-wordpress-org-themes-accessible\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">long-term plan to make make all WordPress.org themes accessible,</a> this small bit of good news regarding admin notices slipped through the cracks. The team ratified a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4Y3K/p1562696178471900\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> from TRT member Danny Cooper to require all themes to use WordPress&#8217; admin_notices API.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All the notifications generated by a theme should use the admin_notices API and follow the core design pattern.</p></blockquote>\n<p>During this week&#8217;s the meeting, Cooper cited Storefront, WooCommerce&#8217;s flagship theme, as one example of a theme-generated notice that does not follow the core design pattern and is shown on every page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/storefront-notice.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Another example is this style of activation notice on the Noto theme from Pixelgrade:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pixelgrade.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Futurio theme has also employed a similar style notice for getting started after activation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/futurio.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In the past these notices have not been expressly forbidden, although they are generally frowned upon by those who want to keep the WordPress admin from being overtaken by large, branded notices and calls to action.</p>\n<p>Another example of an obtrusive notice is Hestia&#8217;s popup that appears if you activate the theme but then navigate to &#8220;Add New&#8221; on the Themes screen to hunt for a different theme. Cooper said this particular popup is likely outside the remit of this guideline, but it demonstrates what lengths theme shops will go to in order to better market their themes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-4.45.08-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>There don&#8217;t seem to be any specific requirements that would restrict the use of branding within the admin notices as long as they follow the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">core design pattern</a>. A visual example of this pattern is shown below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/notices.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Sydney theme has an example of a branding-free notice that works within these guidelines:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sydney.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This new requirement will affect many popular themes on WordPress.org and will likely be applied the next time existing themes go through the update review process. Cooper said that themes already known to be in violation of this guideline will be prompted by the TRT to change their notices as soon as possible or risk suspension.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s especially important that themes on the &#8216;Popular&#8217; tab adapt quickly as other theme developers use them as inspiration when implementing similar functions,&#8221; Cooper said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 22:57:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"WPTavern: 10up Releases New Plugin That Shows How to Extend Gutenberg’s Document Panel Using SlotFill and Filters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91613\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"https://wptavern.com/10up-releases-new-plugin-that-shows-how-to-extend-gutenbergs-document-panel-using-slotfill-and-filters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2350:\"<p>If you&#8217;ve been looking for a way to add slots and controls to the Document panel in WordPress&#8217; content editor, check out a new plugin <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2019/extending-gutenberg-with-slotfill/\">released</a> by 10up called <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/slotfill-and-filter-demos/\">Gutenberg SlotFill and Filter Demos</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SlotFill and Filters is a new take on the classic filters, actions, and hooks system in WordPress.

The repo eventually turned into a library of examples and explanations for SlotFill and JavaScript based filters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January, Welcher <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13361\">submitted a pull request</a> to the Gutenberg repo asking for SlotFill to be added to the document sidebar. His request received positive feedback and not only has SlotFill&#8217;s documentation been added to the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/components/slot-fill/\">WordPress Core Gutenberg Handbook</a>, but the functionality is available in Gutenberg 6.1 and will be available in WordPress 5.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about SlotFill, check out <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2019/extending-gutenberg-with-slotfill/\">Welcher&#8217;s release post</a> or the <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/slotfill-and-filter-demos/\">Gutenberg SlotFill and Filter Demos plugin</a>.

This release brings in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-team-is-exploring-adding-motion-to-block-moving-actions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">animation experiments</a> that Matías Ventura introduced in a post titled “<a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/using-motion-to-express-change/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Using Motion to Express Change</a>.&#8221; The subtle animations add realistic motion to block changes, creation, removal, and reordering, creating a smoother transition between actions. It lends a bit of sophistication to what was previously an instant but more abrupt interaction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Riad Benguella&#8217;s demo video shows the new animation for block reordering. When blocks are added or deleted, content moves around the screen more fluidly, with the surrounding blocks sliding into place. You can test it live and see it in action on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Playground</a>, which is now hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>\n<p>Version 6.1 also incorporates more experiments on the block-based widgets screen that is still in progress. A new widget blocks editor has been added to the Customizer under a panel labeled &#8220;Widget Blocks (Experimental).&#8221; At the moment, editing widgets in the Customizer in such a constricted space doesn&#8217;t seem to make much sense. It&#8217;s easy to get the controls jumbled up on top of each other. Live previews work but are much slower than the experience of using the post editor, and users may wonder why they can&#8217;t simply edit the content on the page where it appears. It&#8217;s important to remember that this is still an experiment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-12.27.28-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The experimental widgets screen has also been updated to include the block inspector and a global inserter.

These include some of the items that are required for theme authors who want to add the accessibility-ready tag.

But if we can incorporate the first four items in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a>, I&#8217;d be super happy. The rest of the criteria, while important, are harder to assess and implement, and have greater impact on  design.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team has agreed to start gradually rolling out new accessibility guidelines every other month while educating developers to help them get on board. The first requirement will be Skip Links, followed by the other three that are outlined in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Review Handbook</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Skip Links</strong><br />\nThemes must include a mechanism that enables users to navigate directly to content or navigation on entering any given page. These links may be positioned off screen initially but must be available to screen reader users and must be visible on focus for sighted keyboard navigators.</li>\n<li><strong>Keyboard Navigation</strong><br />\nTheme authors must provide visual keyboard focus highlighting in navigation menus and for form fields, submit buttons and text links. All controls and links must be reachable using the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Controls</strong><br />\nAll theme features that behave as buttons or links must use button, input, or a elements, to ensure native keyboard accessibility and interaction with screen reader accessibility APIs.<br />\nAll controls must also have machine-readable text to indicate the nature of the control.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Labeling</strong><br />\nComment forms must have appropriate field labels and all content within form tags need to be explicitly associated to a form control. Post-submission responses (errors or confirmations) must be perceivable. If you are using the default WordPress comment or search forms, these pass the accessibility-ready criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The changed requirement wouldn’t encompass all the accessibility-ready requirements to be present on the standard themes, nor would it automatically make them accessibility-ready, but by incorporating one by one requirements, through longer time period, the idea is to encourage theme authors to write accessible themes out of the box,&#8221; TRT member Denis Žoljom said.</p>\n<p>The team is also re-examining the efficacy of the Trusted Authors program and whether there is evidence for discontinuing it. They are considering removing the child theme queue, which was incentivizing authors to submit more child themes since the queue moves faster than the regular one.</p>\n<p>Imposing stricter accessibility requirements for WordPress.org themes is one suggestion that theme authors discussed over the weekend as a potential response to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anders-noren-release-free-chaplin-theme-designed-for-block-editor-theme-authors-discuss-better-ways-to-promote-truly-free-themes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org&#8217;s growing problem with crippleware</a>. The expectation is that stricter requirements would shorten the queue of themes ready for review and perhaps even motivate companies to invest in accessibility testing to improve that process. While it may not have a direct affect on theme companies&#8217; ability to produce crippleware, it makes the barrier for entry higher so that reviewers have more time to focus on improvements to the directory and the review process.</p>\n<p>The new accessibility requirements will apply to all themes hosted on WordPress.org, not just new ones entering the directory. Existing themes will be expected to meet the requirements as they pass through the review process for updates. However, the team will not be actively hunting down old themes to suspend them. Today&#8217;s decision marks an important turning point that has the potential to have a ripple effect across the entire theme industry, as WordPress.org sets the standard for theme development. These new requirements give legs to WordPress&#8217; commitment to accessibility in what TRT member Justin Tadlock called &#8220;a small but major step toward accessibility for all in the directory.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Jul 2019 23:24:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: The News Project Launches Its First Customer Site CALmatters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91539\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/the-news-project-launches-its-first-customer-site-calmatters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2798:\"<p><a href=\"https://thenewsproject.net\">The News Project</a> founded by Merril Brown has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/the-news-projects-publishing-platform-goes-live-with-its-first-customer-calmatters/\">launched</a> its first customer site, <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/blogs/inside-calmatters/2019/07/introducing-a-new-look-for-calmatters/\">CALmatters</a>.

We found a last-minute replacement, but it piqued my curiosity as to better alternatives and I commissioned this survey of eight bakeries to answer the question: What&#8217;s the best Doberge cake in Houston or New Orleans? The article and pictures that follow are from <a href=\"https://alicelevitt.com/\">food critic, travel journalist, and medical science writer Alice Levitt</a>. I hope you enjoy the history, reviews, and surprise winner.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1885, Budapest. Franz Josef I and his wife, Elizabeth, rulers of Austro-Hungary, are attending the National General Exhibition of Budapest. There is much to see, but the emperor’s sweet tooth is pulling him toward one particular display. He simply must taste this new cake he’s been hearing about. He must find the Dobos torte.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-49673\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just any cake. With increased ease in shipping products across the continent thanks to better rail links, Jozsef Dobos&nbsp;had set a goal of getting his cakes into homes across Europe. But while trains were fast they weren’t refrigerated, and fluffy whipped cream-layered fancies would quickly become rancid mush in a hot railway carriage. Innovative delicatessen owner Dobos created the solution: a five-layer cake that took a cue from France with a filling of stable chocolate buttercream, a trend that hadn’t yet hit central Europe. Each layer of vanilla sponge worked with its spackling of buttercream like a well-designed piece of modern architecture, keeping itself cool and dry (but not too dry).&nbsp; For a final flourish — and still more shelf-stability — the whole cake got a crisp caramel jacket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dobos, a proponent of open source before it had a name, gave his recipe to the Budapest Confectioner’s and Gingerbread Maker’s Chamber of Industry in 1906 with the stipulation that it must be shared with anyone who wanted it. The cake traveled widely. Now with seven layers, it made its way to America through Jewish delis that sold it as Seven-Layer Cake. Upscale shops like the St. Moritz Bakery in Greenwich, Connecticut, enrobed it in dark chocolate instead of caramel. For its final bit of Americanization, it turned from a round cake into a rectangle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1933, New Orleans. It was never this hot in Hungary. Beulah Ledner, with her Eastern European blood, was not made for it. Neither were certain cakes, it turned out. During the Great Depression, she earned extra money for her family crafting the German confections her mother had taught her to make.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One favorite was Dobos torte. But despite its Hungarian hardiness, it was not created with sticky Louisiana summers in mind. The wintry pastry needed to lighten up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some bakers had ballooned their cakes to 11 layers. Ledner stuck with a more modest eight. But her stroke of genius was replacing the rich buttercream between the layers with airier custard. Buttercream still made an appearance surrounding the cake, which was then covered in a layer of fondant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She knew no one in New Orleans would take to an Eastern European cake,” her son Albert Ledner told <em>Country Roads</em> magazine. “So she Frenchified the name and called it ‘Doberge.’” With that, the pastry’s fate as a New Orleans classic, alongside King Cake and beignets, was sealed. Her Lowerline Street bakery flooded with customers who called her “the Doberge Queen of New Orleans,” perhaps not realizing that she had invented both the cake and the name. Her business grew into a new spot on South Claiborne Avenue and a new name — the Mrs. Charles Ledner Bakery. The torte options grew, too. Chocolate was the standard flavor, but there were lemon, caramel, and strawberry versions. The half-and-half cake, which allowed customers the option to taste chocolate and lemon in a single go, became the most beloved version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite her success, Ledner sold the business and all its recipes in 1946, blaming health issues and World War II sugar rations. The purchaser, Joe Gambino, adhered strictly to her recipes. He opened his shop, Joe Gambino’s Bakery, in 1949 and has served the cakes to New Orleans and the rest of Louisiana, ever since.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Ledner, part of her deal with Gambino included a five-year embargo on opening a new bakery in New Orleans. But she could only sit still for two, and debuted the Beulah Ledner Bakery in nearby Jefferson Parish in 1948. Demand forced her to change locations yet again and she expanded to Metairie, this time with a bakery designed and built by her architect son. Ledner ran that last bakery until 1981, when she retired at the age of 87. She ate a slice of Doberge for her birthday every year, including at her 94th and final celebration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Doberge’s sugary tendrils also made their way into nearby Houston. There are six businesses in Space City that sell either Doberge or the more classic Jewish-deli-style Seven-Layer Cake. But how to know which to buy for your next birthday? I sampled all six, as well as the best of New Orleans, to figure out which should be avoided and which are worthy centerpieces for a special occasion. They are listed here from worst to best.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Disappointment<br />The Dobasche, <a href=\"http://raosbakery.com/\">Rao’s Bakery</a> </h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: White and double fudge</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Menu says six, but I only got four</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Vanilla and chocolate pudding, purportedly</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Fudge icing, ganache top, and walnuts on the sides</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Just the walnuts</li><li><strong>Pickup experience</strong>: Quick and easy, even on Easter</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Chocolate or lemon</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 6”, 8”, quarter, half, or full sheets</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Johnny Rao opened the original location of his bakery in Beaumont on 1941, almost matching the vintage of Ledner’s cakes. The Champions-area bakery, at the top of North Houston’s internationally varied Veterans Memorial Drive, opened in 2006. Things seemed promising despite the strange spelling, “Dobasche.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a cheerful place, full of families on a Sunday morning, but the cake didn’t live up to the pleasant experience of the bakery. What made this a Doberge? Nothing, really. The four fat layers of cake alternated between too-light chocolate and white. Though the description on the menu said there were both vanilla and chocolate pudding fillings, I could only find a meager swipe of vanilla buttercream holding the layers together. The exterior fudge icing tasted suspiciously like it had been made by Duncan Hines.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>Runners Up<br />Chocolate Daubache, <a href=\"https://fgbakery.com/\">French Gourmet Bakery</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: Vanilla</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Six — four thin, two thick</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Fudge icing</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: More of the same fudge icing</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: A few swirls on top</li><li><strong>Pickup experience</strong>: Exceptional. The counter staffer even offered to carry the cake to the car.</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Chocolate or strawberry</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 8”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ramain family has been running this ladies-who-lunch destination since 1973. Yes, the raison d’être is French-inspired mousse cakes, macarons, and eclairs, but there’s a menu of “American Cakes,” too. The Daubache is served with strawberry filling by default, but is available in a chocolate version as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The six layers here were the most uneven, with two thick ones in the middle resembling buck teeth in a sea of average-sized chompers. There was nothing truly wrong with this cake, but it was really just an acceptable, if slightly oversweet, layer cake with nothing to distinguish it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Seven-Layer Chocolate Cake, <a href=\"https://3brothersbakery.com/\">Three Brothers Bakery</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cake</strong>: Fluffy, vanilla-scented<br /><strong>Layers</strong>: Seven<br /><strong>Filling</strong>: Chocolate buttercream<br /><strong>Exterior</strong>: Fudge icing<br /><strong>Decorations</strong>: Icing swirls and chocolate sprinkles with a cherry on top.<br /><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: Placed the order online, and pick-up was friendly and easy.<br /><strong>Flavors</strong>: Chocolate or mocha<br /><strong>Sizes</strong>: One size, which feeds about 10-12</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a cake with history. Why not go to a comparably storied bakery? The Three Brothers saga began in 1825 with the opening of Morris Jucker’s bakery in Chrzanow, Poland. The family continued to run the business there until they were rounded up and sent to a concentration camp in 1941. Brothers Sigmund, Sol, and Max Jucker all survived to open their first Houston bakery in 1949.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the good news. The bad news is that the brothers adapted to American tastes by raising the amount of sugar in their recipes. The buttercream in their Seven Layer Cake made my teeth hurt. But the fudge icing on the outside was less sweet and deeply chocolaty, enhanced with a layer of chocolate sprinkles. I ended up focusing on the perimeter of the large slice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Classic<br />Doberge Cake, Gambino&#8217;s</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: Fluffy but sturdy and moist vanilla buttermilk cake</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Six</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Coffee-infused chocolate custard</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Chocolate buttercream and fondant</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Pretty buttercream flowers</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: Was able to pick up from case without pre-ordering.</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Chocolate, lemon, caramel, or a mix</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 8”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is history. Gambino’s takes great care in crafting every cake, including baking each of its layers separately, rather than cutting one big cake into pieces. Custard is made from scratch for each specimen. And the half-and-half cakes are still one of the Metairie bakery’s best-sellers. I snapped up a chocolate cake straight from the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ledner’s attempt at Americanizing her cake by adding more sugar is clear. The buttercream crunched with crystals of it. Combined with the fondant, it was unpleasantly sweet, though I liked the earthiness of the coffee in the chocolate custard.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Original<br />Seven-Layer Dobash Torte, <a href=\"https://www.thevillagebakeryhouston.com/\">Village Bakery</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Seven</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Chocolate buttercream</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Chocolate buttercream, topped with a layer of lady fingers and caramel</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Nope</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: Very pleasant.</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Almost endless.</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: Up to you. Cakes are entirely custom.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The name Dobash is misleading; this is no New Orleans delicacy. Of all the cakes I tried, this is closest to Dobos’ original, down to the crunchy coating of caramel, now a rarity. The rectangular shape, however, may owe to Jewish owner Richard Jucker. (I also picked up a day-old bag of his varied, not-too-sweet <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/the-nosher/what-are-hamantaschen/\">Hamantaschen</a> while I was there.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Any resemblance to the Three Brothers cake is no coincidence. Jucker’s father was one of the founders of that bakery and the younger baker worked there from 1981 to 1999. But just as he broke away, this cake is very much its own torte. Fluffy, vanilla-scented layers are surrounded by buttercream that verges on too sweet, especially with the addition of the caramel, but never overwhelms as some of the others do. This is a Dobos torte for the traditionalist — and the client interested in enhancing their cake with flavors like pistachio or almond buttercream. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Upgrade<br />Seven-Layer Cake, <a href=\"https://www.kennyandziggys.com/\">Kenny &amp; Ziggy’s</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: Yellow</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Seven</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Chocolate mousse</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Chocolate ganache</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Toasted almonds on the sides</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Just chocolate</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: Only one, a whopping two feet, eight inches. Catering director Jeanne Magenheim estimates that each one feeds up to 28 people.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to believe that Houston is home to one of the world’s best remaining Jewish delis, but thanks to living piece of culinary history Ziggy Gruber — whose family came to the U.S. from Hungary in the early 20th century and opened New York’s famous Rialto Deli — it has been since 1999. The Deli Man himself designed his Seven-Layer cake to be a cut above the classic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of buttercream, he ups the ante with intense chocolate mousse. A thick layer of ganache surrounds the outsized square slices of almond-bedecked layer cake. This would be my favorite if not for the too-light cake itself. Just a hint more substance, and this would be close to perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Specialist<br />Chocolate Doberge, <a href=\"https://debbiedoesdoberge.com/\">Debbie Does Doberge</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: White, sturdy but moist</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Seven</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Custard</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Poured fondant</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: You can request buttercream roses or fleurs de lis.</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Endless, including pistachio, fig/white chocolate/goat cheese, and rum-spiked Bananas Foster.</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 6” through 16”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A designer friend described the cakes here, crafted by Charlotte McGehee and Charles Mary IV, as having the concise beauty of a sports car. Each slice is simply perfect. The balance of each precisely even layer of cake to complementary custard filling feels like eating cake in Plato’s cave.&nbsp; The care taken in each detail is evident, down to the soft, uncommonly edible fondant coating on each slice, whether it covers a well-spiced carrot cake or indulgently minty chocolate one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it the best Doberge being produced in the world today? Almost certainly. But right now, the New Orleans company doesn’t ship. (They hope to start again soon.) When it does, this should be the option (smeared) on everyone’s lips. But until then, I’ll fly to New Orleans just to grab a slice of rainbow-striped cake with almond custard and sigh.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h4>The Standout<br />New Orleans Daubache, <a href=\"http://acadianbakers.com/\">The Acadian Bakers</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cake</strong>: Fluffy vanilla</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: Six&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Filling</strong>: Chocolate custard</li><li><strong>Exterior</strong>: Ganache</li><li><strong>Decorations</strong>: Chocolate swirls and hearts, as well as two chocolate-covered strawberries.</li><li><strong>Pick up experience</strong>: Cake was more than an hour late, with little apology.</li><li><strong>Flavors</strong>: Just chocolate</li><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: 9”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acadian Bakers has the best Doberge option for a Houston resident; pastry chef Sandra Bubbert has been turning out craveable cakes for more than 36 years.

Chaplin could be loosely described as an agency or business stye theme but the capabilities of the block editor enable users to create advanced page layouts that would suit many different types of websites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chaplin.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The layout for the front page shown in the screenshots can be easily recreated by adding a new page, selecting &#8220;Cover Template&#8221; for the page template, and adding a featured image. Users can then add columns, images, and paragraph text using the block editor to recreate the structure of the demo. Norén has included detailed instructions in the theme&#8217;s readme.txt file for setting it up to look like the demo.</p>\n<p>Font and color settings can both be found in the Customizer and these styles will be reflected in the block editor for a more realistic preview of the content. Chaplin comes with infinite scroll built in and additional settings for displaying and hiding specific post meta on archives and single posts. The theme has logo support, widget areas, a social menu with icons, sticky header support, and a search overlay. Check out the <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/chaplin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see all the features in action.</p>\n<p>Shortly before the release of WordPress 5.0, Norén worked to get all of his themes <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/authors-of-popular-wordpress-org-themes-rolling-out-gutenberg-compatibility-updates-ahead-of-5-0-release\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">compatible with the new block editor</a>. Most of his previous themes were created to be niche-specific and easy to have looking just like the demo upon activation. One drawback was that the only way to really customize his themes was to create a child theme and add/or custom CSS, something that is out of reach for most WordPress users.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.andersnoren.se/enter-stage-left-chaplin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> introducing the theme, Norén described how the new block editor inspired him to start building themes differently than he had in the past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For a while, though, I’ve been thinking about how I could build a theme more customizable than the ones I’ve been making so far,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With the introduction of the Block Editor in WordPress 5.0, any page on a WordPress site can accommodate pretty much any layout, making WordPress itself a lot more flexible than it was just a year ago. If the Block Editor would enable users to create any layout on their site, and the theme would allow them to style the layouts however they want, then that could end up being pretty useful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chaplin is a successful departure from Norén&#8217;s previously static themes that gives users more freedom simply by making the block editor the main vehicle for creating and rearranging the home page layout. No two customizations will look exactly alike because users can arrange blocks in any combination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chaplin-collage-compressed.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This theme is a good example of the possibilities that the block editor opens up for users who want more control of their sites&#8217; layouts and content without having to wade through pages of documentation and dozens of panels of Customizer options. In many ways, themes that fully embrace the block editor are beginning to make older themes seem two-dimensional. This shift in focus is an important milestone in the evolution of theme development.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Theme Authors Discuss Better Ways to Promote Quality Themes on WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Based on the community <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andersnoren/status/1146000192795271168\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">response</a> to Chaplin&#8217;s release, it&#8217;s clear that there is a real demand for themes made specifically for the block editor. However, WordPress.org is not currently set up to promote themes like this.</p>\n<p>If you filter for &#8220;block editor styles&#8221; and &#8220;wide blocks&#8221; when searching for themes, WordPress.org search currently returns just 26 themes.</p>\n<p>Unless you already know about a specific theme and search for it, the best themes are difficult to find. The Featured and Popular Tabs inside WordPress&#8217; theme browser do little to surface block-ready themes.</p>\n<p>In a related <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/1147472529113698311\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> that popped up over the weekend, long time Theme Review Team member Justin Tadlock contends that the WordPress.org theme directory is &#8220;becoming little more than a crippleware distributor.&#8221; He is referring to those themes that do not enable users to further customize them but rather lock away certain features behind upsells.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Essentially, many themes submitted are a &#8216;lite&#8217; or &#8216;free&#8217; version of a commercial theme with extremely reduced functionality,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;For example, we had a theme author trying to upsell access to post formats (a core feature) the other day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fellow Theme Review Team member Danny Cooper <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannycooper147/status/1147569548855562245\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cited</a> Elementor&#8217;s Hello Theme as one example of &#8220;the new breed of themes that only exist to &#8216;sell&#8217; something else.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Participants in the discussion suggested WordPress.org employ stricter enforcement of upsells or implement a more nuanced tag system that would identify themes that have some features locked for users who don&#8217;t purchase an upgrade. Others suggested theme authors meet the minimum accessibility requirements as a new threshold for entry into the directory, which would likely slash the number of themes waiting to be reviewed and incentivize companies to invest in accessibility testing to improve that process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, I would prefer all themes with upsell to be filtered out into their own section of the directory, so it’s clear to visitors what themes are free and what themes are &#8216;free,&#8217; Norén said in response to the discussion. &#8220;It would also reduce the incentive for theme shops to flood the directory with crippled themes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Norén is one of a handful of theme authors who are submitting high quality themes to the directory that are truly free from upsells. In a time when it&#8217;s still not common to find new themes built specifically for the block editor, WordPress.org might benefit from featuring these themes in the same way it does for block-enabled plugins.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Jul 2019 22:10:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 359 – Diversity Speaker Training With Jill Binder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91436&preview=true&preview_id=91436\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-359-diversity-speaker-training-with-jill-binder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2523:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://jillbinder.com/\">Jill Binder</a>, Founder, and Chief Consultant and Trainer at <a href=\"http://diversein.tech\">Diverse Speakers In Tech</a>.

More than 500 million websites use robots.txt files to talk to bots, according to Google&#8217;s data. Up until now, there has never been an official Internet standard, no documented specification for writing the rules correctly according to the protocol. Over the years, developers shared their various interpretations of the protocol, but this created many different ambiguous methods for controlling crawlers.</p>\n<p>Google is working together with Martijn Koster, the original author of the protocol, webmasters, and other search engines to <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/07/rep-id.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create a proposal</a> to submit to the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/standards/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) for standardizing the REP:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The proposed REP draft reflects over 20 years of real world experience of relying on robots.txt rules, used both by Googlebot and other major crawlers, as well as about half a billion websites that rely on REP. These fine grained controls give the publisher the power to decide what they&#8217;d like to be crawled on their site and potentially shown to interested users. It doesn&#8217;t change the rules created in 1994, but rather defines essentially all undefined scenarios for robots.txt parsing and matching, and extends it for the modern web.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The proposed specification includes several major items that webmasters and developers will want to review. It extends the use of robots.txt to any URI-based transfer protocol (FTP, CoAP, et al), instead of limiting it to HTTP. It also implements a new maximum caching time of 24 hours and lets website owners update robots.txt whenever they choose, without having crawlers overload their sites with requests. If a previously accessible robots.txt file becomes inaccessible for whatever reason, crawlers will respect the known disallowed pages that were previously identified for &#8220;a reasonably long period of time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google has also <a href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/07/googles-robotstxt-parser-is-now-open.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced</a> the C++ library it uses for parsing and matching rules in robots.txt files, along with a testing tool for testing the rules. Developers can use this parser to create parsers that use the proposed REP requirements. It has been updated to ensure that Googlebot only crawls what it&#8217;s allowed to and is now <a href=\"https://github.com/google/robotstxt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This library has been around for 20 years and it contains pieces of code that were written in the 90&#8217;s,&#8221; Google&#8217;s Search Open Sourcing team said in the <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/07/repp-oss.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. &#8220;Since then, the library evolved; we learned a lot about how webmasters write robots.txt files and corner cases that we had to cover for, and added what we learned over the years also to the internet draft when it made sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lizzi Harvey, who maintains Google&#8217;s Search developer docs, updated the robots.txt spec to match the REP draft. Check out the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_txt#what-changed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full list of changes</a> if you want to compare your robots.txt file to the proposed spec. If the proposal for standardizing the REP is successfully adopted by the IETF, the days of googling and wading through undocumented robots.txt rules will soon be over.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2019 19:11:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Font Awesome is Branching out with Duotone Colors and Icon Smashups\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91328\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/font-awesome-is-branching-out-with-duotone-colors-and-icon-smashups\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2617:\"<p><a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&v=5.9.0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Font Awesome 5.9</a> was released last month with 421 new and updated icons.

I was “gifted” so learning came easy and I enjoyed it.  From ages 6 to 18, I went to competitive accelerated schools designed to churn out college students. It was a narrow path I’d been set on, without encouragement to explore beyond.</p>\n<p>Majoring in theater was a no-brainer. It was the only thing I’d done my whole life, so I figured I wouldn’t get bored. My mom was a stage manager so it has always been easy to bring me to rehearsals with her when working a show. I ended up in close to 20 different productions between 5 and 13. Plus, Florida State University had a great theatre program and in-state tuition was cheap. So I went.</p>\n<p>But I wasn’t there because I wanted to be. I’d gone simply because I felt I <i>had</i> to go to college, regardless of what I did when I got there. I liked theater a lot, but I didn’t love it the way my classmates did. Self-doubt crept in. Depression overcame me. Anxiety and self-hatred took root. I stopped going to class. I isolated myself from my friends who &#8211; going through their own stuff &#8211;  were too busy to notice.</p>\n<p>At 19, I dropped out.</p>\n<h3>Straying from the path</h3>\n<p>With me, I took thousands in debt, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and a bruised ego. I wandered, directionless for the first time in my life.</p>\n<p>I felt like a failure. I did not know who or what I was anymore, I had no community and I belonged nowhere. I was crippled by my concurrent depression and lack of a diploma. What was my path now?</p>\n<p>My mother spent her whole life working in the arts and that made her happy. I wanted the same thing. But we were always pinching pennies. I didn’t want that for myself, and I didn’t want my kids to grow up with that burden. So I thought to myself, “What can I do that’s creative, won’t be boring, and can earn me an income?”</p>\n<p>I don’t remember if there was a lightbulb moment where I realized web design checked all my boxes. But that was there I landed.</p>\n<p>I started getting my toes wet with HTML and CSS, but coding didn’t come easily to me. I didn’t have a computer, so I would write out lines of code by hand in order to memorize syntax. It didn’t click and just swam in front of my eyes. It was difficult, so I gave up.</p>\n<p>For a year and a half, I lived in a few different cities, from Ft Lauderdale all the way to Los Angeles, working some retail and food service jobs. I learned about customer service, the balance between maintenance and growth, and found myself more than a little bit fascinated by marketing.  I began to learn how to juggle the depression and anxiety that lived in my head.</p>\n<p>No matter where I went, web design was sitting in the back of my brain. I was shut down when I tried to suggest changes to the booking system of a salon I worked at. I found myself sketching redesigns of the website of the bar where I picked up shifts. I started learning again after moving back to Florida. This time, I found online resources like Udemy and CodeSchool and it all began to click.</p>\n<h3>Finding a new path</h3>\n<p>While I still didn’t love code itself, I loved the idea of building something from nothing. It all hearkened back to theater: rallying the knowledge and experience of multiple people, laying out a plan, inventing some creative solutions along the way, iteration after iteration until it functions and yields a result, then presenting it as a living and breathing product. I had learned about story-telling via script analysis classes in college as well as spacing and color psychology. I had always been academic, so I found ease and comfort in things like databases and content writing. My intellectual and creative side were merging, dancing together in one elegant performance.</p>\n<p>In 2015, I applied for a web design internship at a small agency. It was here where WordPress and I first met. I was amazed that I could easily build websites with limited coding knowledge. I attended my first WordCamp in Miami, where I watched people like Morten Hendricksen and Michelle Schlup live what I wished I could be doing.</p>\n<p>I was promoted to a full employee in a poisonous environment. I had to work long hours and was accused of not being a team player if I didn’t. I was guilt-tripped with gifts and compliments. I was asked to do tasks I hadn’t been trained in and was berated when I struggled. I left one day after about a year, in tears. The despair, loneliness and frustration were unassailable.  I had failed, yet again, to move forward on the path I felt I belonged on.</p>\n<h3>Setting my own path</h3>\n<p>I had no savings and no car, so I was left with a choice: apply to work at the Wendy’s that was walking distance up the street, or find a way to make money out of thin air. Taking inventory of my skills:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I knew WordPress</li>\n<li>I knew how <i>not</i> to run a business</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I started building small sites for friends and family. I scrambled to learn how to invoice properly, how to handle contracts, how to get taxes paid. I googled a lot and failed often. But it was rewarding and creative, so I stuck to it.</p>\n<p>In 2017, I felt confident enough to apply to speak at WordCamp Miami. It had been 2 years since I had attended the first and I was floored when I was accepted.</p>\n<p>In the three years that I ran my business, I worked with clients from all over the world. I used WordPress daily to build and break, support and scale websites for other business owners like me. I wore every hat I could balance: CEO, CFO, designer, developer, marketer, and support staff in one.</p>\n<p>While I appeared “successful” (whatever that means) I was paddling like crazy beneath the surface and was constantly stretched to my limit. I achieved decent work-life boundaries and found satisfaction in the work, but being depressed while running a business is easier said than done.</p>\n<p>In early 2019, as my bank account began to dry up, I began to seriously consider throwing in the towel.</p>\n<h3>A fork in the path</h3>\n<p>I spoke at WordCamp Miami that year. The entire camp buoyed my spirits; this time, there were faces and topics I recognized. I went with my friend, Louise Treadwell, who made the entire experience less frightening.</p>\n<p>And the universe was looking out for me. The very first person I met that day was Adam Warner.</p>\n<p>He saw my talk and I suppose he saw something in me that he liked. By the end of the conference, my head was swimming with the opportunity he had presented to me: to travel as a GoDaddy Pro Speaker Ambassador.</p>\n<p>I felt that electric sensation again of my two halves &#8211; academic and creative &#8211; merging. It was the first time the community had reached out and taken a firm, confident grasp of my hand. And I was in exactly the right spot to accept it.</p>\n<p>The idea of attending more WordCamps was thrilling. I vowed to myself that I would up my Twitter game. After all, all my WordCamp heroes were active on Twitter and I was desperate to be where the action was.</p>\n<p>I grabbed as many opportunities as I could to remain visible. I wrote blog posts and made YouTube videos to prove what I knew, to myself as much as others. I wanted to earn my place at the table by giving back into the community that had plucked me out of my despair.</p>\n<h3>Time to merge</h3>\n<p>I’d done a podcast episode with Michelle Ames and I noticed she worked for the plugin, GiveWP. Out of curiosity, I wandered over to their careers page and saw an opening for a support tech. I had the job within 3 days.</p>\n<p>I’ve done a lot of things out of fear that many people find brave. I was told I was brave for majoring in theater, but I’d done it because I didn’t want to fail at something unfamiliar. I was told I was brave for moving to Los Angeles after I dropped out, but I was afraid to be stagnant. I was told I was brave to start my own business, but I was afraid to work for someone else.</p>\n<p>I do feel fear. Fear that I don’t know enough, that I’m too young or inexperienced, that I’ll let down the people who have cheered me on, that I’ll end up vulnerable the way I was in my last job. That I’ll get hurt. That being a black, queer, woman in the tech space will be too challenging.</p>\n<p>I’m comforted by the knowledge that most WordPress people don’t care what gender/color/sexuality you are… as long as you keep your plugins updated. Open-source means you’re not here to out-do the next person, but to contribute toward a common goal. I can dive into support at Give with WordPress as my base, my constant. I can finally acknowledge that I am worth being part of a team. It means all the difference in the world.</p>\n<h3>Who invented this path nonsense anyway?</h3>\n<p>I don’t have to be on a path anymore. I can let myself remain open to possibilities and say “yes” more. I don’t have to decide what I’m going to be, <i>I can just become it,</i> because I can trust myself and the foundation that WordPress has given me. WordPress, with it’s limitless contributors, versions, and possibilities, reminds us that we should be excited by change, not afraid.</p>\n<p>I believe that giving up what I worked for 3 years to build is the bravest thing I’ve done so far. At first, I was furious at myself that I couldn’t make my own business as sustainable as I’d wanted. Moving to Give felt like failing. But Louise called it “failing up” which I think is pretty apt. It was a step forward into something I could grow into and really succeed at, rather than sticking with the familiar like I had always done.</p>\n<p>I often remind myself of a quote from Buffy the Vampire Slayer which, ironically, I watched for the first time while in some the deepest throes of my depression: <i>“</i><i>I&#8217;m cookie dough. I&#8217;m not done baking. I&#8217;m not finished becoming who ever the hell it is I&#8217;m gonna turn out to be.” </i></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: I Am Cookie Dough\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=I%20Am%20Cookie%20Dough&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-am-cookie-dough%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: I Am Cookie Dough\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-am-cookie-dough%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fi-am-cookie-dough%2F&title=I+Am+Cookie+Dough\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: I Am Cookie Dough\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/i-am-cookie-dough/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070319-150x150.jpg&description=I Am Cookie Dough\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: I Am Cookie Dough\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-am-cookie-dough/\" title=\"I Am Cookie Dough\"></a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-am-cookie-dough/\">I Am Cookie Dough</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2019 12:00:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Allie Nimmons\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Walking 718km to WCEU, an Interview With Marcel Bootsman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91357\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/walking-748km-to-wceu-an-interview-with-marcel-bootsman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2209:\"<p>I have a hard time walking a mile or two let alone 718km, but that&#8217;s what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbootsman\">Marcel Bootsman</a> did on his journey to <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/\">WordCamp EU</a> to generate funds for <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this interview, Bootsman explains how he prepared for the journey, what he experienced during his trip, and why he chose DonateWC as the charity to raise funds for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I was curious about was what Bootsman thought about during those long stretches where he had plenty of time to think to himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The thing that I noticed is that my thinking had changed during the month.

Although the plugin hasn&#8217;t officially launched yet, a <a href=\"https://msgwp.com/demo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the website allows people to anonymously publish a post to msgWP&#8217;s demo blog from their own Telegram accounts by launching a Telegram bot.</p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s creator, <a href=\"https://github.com/meszarosrob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Róbert Mészáros</a>, said he plans to launch it in late summer or early fall, after collecting more feedback from beta testers and polishing the website. Mészáros is a developer who mainly works on a contract or freelance basis. Although msgWP isn&#8217;t is first WordPress plugin, it is the first one he has created as a product to promote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s highly unlikely that I&#8217;ll make msgWP available on the WordPress.org Plugin Directory, but it&#8217;s going to be GPL licensed,&#8221; Mészáros said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Support, automatic updates, and restricted content will be available only for those who buy a plan. Since I&#8217;m using msgWP myself and I plan to donate a part of profit back to the community, to the WordPress Foundation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the plugins available that integrate Telegram with WordPress either broadcast to a channel or display the feed of a public channel in a widget. This is the first plugin that sends Telegram user-generated content into WordPress.</p>\n<p>I tested the demo last night and successfully posted a text to the demo blog. Images do not yet appear to be working on the demo or may be disabled for now. Mészáros said the demo implementation unhooks some of the checks that are enabled by default on the plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-02-at-12.36.31-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>When the msgWP plugin is used on a site, administrators need to allow a Telegram account to create posts explicitly. This setting is available in the admin screen where you can enter the username of a Telegram account. Adding multiple usernames to the whitelist opens up some interesting possibilities for group blogging.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since every Telegram message contains information about the Telegram account, we can filter out those who are not whitelisted,&#8221; Mészáros said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, the fact that users are explicitly whitelisted opens up the way to have user level settings. For example, you can set a specific category for a Telegram account or only give them the option to create draft posts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you whitelist yourself you have a microblog; if you whitelist 20 users with various settings, you can cover a live event with Telegram and msgWP.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The msgWP plugin also checks the IP of the request. If it falls outside a particular IP range, msgWP can recognize that it&#8217;s not from Telegram and block it.</p>\n<p>Mészáros&#8217; inspiration for the plugin came from his principles regarding centralized social media. While he maintains a private blog where his friends follow him, Mészáros&#8217; doesn&#8217;t use platforms like Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel strongly about blogging and microblogging,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s not all rainbows – if you have one, you know that it takes a certain kind of commitment and effort.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mészáros said he was also inspired &#8220;by an almost forgotten history of WordPress,&#8221; wherein many took advantage of its support for XML-RPC to blog from desktop blog editors, like MarsEdit, BlogJet, and BlogDesk, without ever logging into the admin. He contends that third-party tools like this demonstrate that <a href=\"https://msgwp.com/what-is-wordpress-without-its-editor-we-are-not-sure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress is more than the editor</a>.</p>\n<p>Since msgWP is already integrated into the messaging workflow for Telegram users, it may inspire some to blog more often. Posting is faster than using Twitter, Facebook, or even the WordPress mobile apps, albeit with far fewer features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paradoxically we want to encourage people to use WordPress by not reminding them that they run their sites/microblogs on WordPress,&#8221; Mészáros said. &#8220;A messaging app has some informality to it, and that will help a lot. All you need is to write and press send. After all, you are sending texts, and not publishing structured articles on your blog after too many glasses of wine. For this reason, we don&#8217;t see msgWP with Telegram as a replacement for the WP Mobile Apps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the convenience promised through various apps, the concept of microblogging on one&#8217;s own website does not seem to have taken off yet. Services like <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">micro.blog</a>, which integrate with existing WordPress blogs, are still used by a fervent few and have not yet gained mainstream adoption. Even the “Press This” feature that was included in WordPress core prior to 2017, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/press-this-removed-from-wordpress-4-9-in-favor-of-a-plugin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">retired in favor of a canonical plugin</a>, with discontinued support for the bookmarklet feature. It hasn&#8217;t been updated for two years and is only installed on approximately 10,000 sites.</p>\n<p>Postcard, a social sharing and microblogging app that integrated with WordPress, is another tool that was aimed at fundamentally changing how people use social networks. It was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/postcard-project-discontinued-ios-and-android-apps-now-open-source\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discontinued due to the development burden</a> of supporting multiple apps.</p>\n<p>There are many different solutions that have popped up over the years for enabling quick posts or microblogging, all with vastly different approaches. msgWP has an advantage in that Mészáros can leverage the power and speed of Telegram, along with all of its mobile and desktop clients, without having to maintain that aspect of the publishing interface. Even if it doesn&#8217;t spark a wildfire of microblogging across the web, it may offer users a convenient alternative to posting content inside social media silos, especially for niche use cases like group microblogging for live events.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Jul 2019 22:36:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"Matt: Just Write with David Perell\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=49754\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://ma.tt/2019/07/just-write-with-david-perrell/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:594:\"<p>I had an <a href=\"https://www.perell.com/podcast/matt-mulleweg\">interesting conversation with David Perell on his North Star Podcast that I recommend checking out</a>.

Education WP theme uses LearnPress, <strong>the #1 WP LMS plugin on WordPress.org &#8211; the official WordPress Plugins Directory</strong>, which offers you a whole lot of benefits, such as: easy to update, independent from the theme, easy to change theme or update in future. <a href=\"https://thimpress.com/create-udemy-coursera-clone-easily-learnpress/\" rel=\"nofollow\">You will be able to make Udemy, Coursera or Edx education websites in minutes.</a></p> \n\n<p>Using Education WP, you will own a pack of <a href=\"https://thimpress.com/product/learnpress-add-ons-bundle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LearnPress premium add-ons</a>.

He works for ServMask Inc and is responsible for the Quality Assurance process for All-in-One WP Migration plugin. <br><br>He believes in the Buddhist teaching that “the most valuable service is one rendered to our fellow humans,” and his contributions demonstrates this through his WordPress translation work and multi-lingual support projects for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7023\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?w=1728&amp;ssl=1 1728w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/60340743_2330687777177099_8058690662683377664_o.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" /><figcaption>Bhutanese contributors to the Dzongkha locale on WordPress Translation Day</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Ugyen started his career with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2016, Ugyen was looking for a new job after his former cloud company ran into financial difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview he was asked many questions about WordPress and, although he had a basic understanding of WordPress, he struggled to give detailed answers. After that interview he resolved to develop his skills and learn as much about WordPress as he could.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months passed and he received a call from ServMask Inc, who had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration. They offered him a position, fulfilling his wish to work with WordPress full-time. And because of that, Ugyen is now an active contributor to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordCamp Bangkok 2018</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Bangkok 2018 was a turning point event for Ugyen. WordCamps are a great opportunity to meet WordPress community members you don’t otherwise get to know, and he was able to attend his first WordCamp through the sponsorship of his company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first day of WordCamp Bangkok was a Contributor Day, where people volunteer to work together to contribute to the development of WordPress. Ugyen joined the Community team to have conversations with WordPress users from all over the world. He was able to share his ideas for supporting new speakers, events and organizers to help build the WordPress community in places where it is not yet booming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the main day of the event, Ugyen managed a photo booth for speakers, organizers, and attendees to capture their memories of WordCamp.&nbsp;He also got to take some time out to attend several presentations during the conference. What particularly stuck in Ugyen’s mind was learning that having a website content plan has been shown to lead to 100% growth in business development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Co-Organizing<strong> Thimphu</strong>&#8216;s <strong>WordPress Meetup</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After attending WordCamp Bangkok 2018 as well as a local Meetup event, Ugyen decided to&nbsp;introduce WordPress to his home country and cities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the WordPress Translation Day organizers, he realized that his local language, Dzongkha, was not as fully translated as other languages in the WordPress Core Translation. That is when Ugyen knew that he wanted to help build his local community. He organized Thimphu’s first WordPress Meetup to coincide with WordPress Translation Day 4, and it was a huge success!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all WordPress Meetups, the Thimpu WordPress Meetup is an easygoing, volunteer-organized, non-profit meetup which covers everything related to WordPress. But it also keeps in mind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness\">Bhutanese Gross National Happiness</a> four pillars by aiming to preserve and promote their unique culture and national language.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Big dreams get accomplished one step at a time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugyen has taken an active role in preserving his national language by encouraging his community to use WordPress, including Dzongkha bloggers, online Dzongkha news outlets, and government websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while Ugyen has only been actively involved in the community for a short period, he has contributed much to the WordPress community, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>becoming a Translation Contributor for WordPress Core Translation for Dzongkha;</li><li>participating in the <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">Global WordPress Translation Day 4</a> Livestream and organizing team;</li><li>inviting WordPress Meetup Thimphu members and WordPress experts from other countries to join the <a href=\"https://wpbhutan.slack.com/\">local Slack instance</a>;</li><li>encouraging ServMask Inc. to become an event sponsor;</li><li>providing the Dzongkha Development Commission the opportunity to involve their language experts.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to WordPress, Ugyen particularly focuses on encouraging local and international language WordPress bloggers;&nbsp;helping startups succeed with WordPress;&nbsp;and sharing what he has learned from WordPress with his Bhutanese WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor, Ugyen hopes to accomplish even more for the Bhutan and Asian WordPress Communities. His dreams for his local community are big, including teaching more people about open source, hosting a local WordCamp, and helping to organize WordCamp Asia in 2020 &#8212; all while raising awareness of his community.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo-1.jpg?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7026\" width=\"110\" height=\"83\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post is based on an article originally published on HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DeRosia</a>.

This is a feature that has traditionally been handled by plugins, which has resulted in many different implementations across different sites. It also means that many sites do not have XML sitemaps, which can be a problem because they are hugely important to having your site correctly indexed by search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal details how core sitemaps would be structured and how the team would build them, as well as what aspects of WordPress would not be considered appropriate information to be included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building this feature?

E2e testing, which has been successfully used by Gutenberg, is used to simulate real user scenarios and validate process flows. Currently, the setup requires <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/install/\">Docker</a> to run, and a number of e2e test utilities are already available in the&nbsp; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/e2e-test-utils/src\">@wordpress/e2e-test-utils</a> package, in the Gutenberg repository.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to use this feature?

Two new packages have been created that require code review and testing. The first is an Autoload Package, a foundational package for theme developers who are not currently using Composer (although <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a> is recommended instead of this package). The second is a Customizer Section Button Package that allows theme authors to create a link/button to any URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other proposed ideas for packages that require feedback and additional discussion.

You can read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/wordpress-5-2-field-guide/\">the field guide for this release</a> for more detailed information about what was included and how it all works.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>327 individual volunteers contributed to the release. If you would like to be a part of that number for future releases, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core\">the Core team blog</a> and join the #core channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Successful WordPress Translation Day 4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Translation Day is a 24-hour event organised by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">the Polyglots team</a> where community members from all over the world come together to translate WordPress into their local languages. For the fourth edition held on 11 May, 183 brand new contributors joined the Polyglots team from 77 communities across 35 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WP Translation Day is a great time for focussed contributions to localizing WordPress, but these contributions can happen at any time of the year, so if you would like to help make WordPress available in your local language, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots\">the Polyglots team blog</a> and join the #polyglots channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated Plugin Guidelines Proposal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Plugins team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/\">has proposed some updates</a> to the guidelines for developers on the Plugin Directory.

If you would like to be involved in this discussion, comment on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/\">the proposal</a> and join the #plugin review team in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Continued Gutenberg Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the block editor was first released as part of WordPress Core in v5.0, development has continued in leaps and bounds with a new release every two weeks. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-29th-may/\">The latest update</a> includes some great incremental improvements that will be merged into the 5.2.2 release of WordPress along with the other recent enhancements.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the editor enhancements, work has been ongoing in the Gutenberg project to bring the block editing experience to the rest of the WordPress dashboard. This second phase of the project has been going well and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/05/31/gutenberg-phase-2-friday-design-update-20/\">the latest update</a> shows how much work has been done so far.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to that, the Block Library project that aims to bring a searchable library of available blocks right into the editor is deep in the planning phase with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/05/28/block-library-initial-explorations/\">a recent update</a> showing what direction the team is taking things.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved in planning and development of Gutenberg and the block editor, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/\">Design</a> team blogs and join the #core, #design, and #core-editor channels in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The 5.2.2 release of WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/28/5-2-2-release-agenda/\">is currently in development</a> with a planned release date of 13 June.</li><li>Version 2.1.1 of the WordPress Coding Standards <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/releases/tag/2.1.1\">has been released</a> containing seven small, but relevant fixes.</li><li>The Theme Review Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/05/07/trusted-authors-changes/\">have updated the details</a> of how the Trusted Authors Program works.</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/05/29/who-wants-to-test-the-new-wordcamp-blocks/\">WordCamp-specific blocks have been launched for WordCamp sites</a> with organizers needing to sign up in order to test them out.</li><li>Continuing the growing trend of other platforms adopting the Gutenberg editor, it has now <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/plugin/reazzon-gutenberg\">been ported to a plugin for OctoberCMS</a>.</li><li>Version 3.0 of the popular WordPress development environment, Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV), <a href=\"https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blog/2019/05/15/vvv-3-0-0.html\">was released this month</a>.</li><li>The Community Team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/05/31/the-4-gets-in-wordpress-community-organizing/\">published some info</a> clarifying what organizers get (and don’t get) from being involved with their local communities. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have a story that we should include in the next “Month in WordPress” post?

This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?
